# harness-doctor -- preflight check for lode's agent harness.
#
# Verifies the things the pipeline assumes and that fail confusingly when absent:
# prerequisites on PATH, the guard scripts present and executable, the hooks wired,
# the tracker's auto-import invariant, and the worktree directory.
#
# Read-only: it inspects and reports, it never installs or repairs anything. Fixing
# is a human decision, and a doctor that silently mutates state is one more thing to
# distrust when the pipeline misbehaves.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = everything required is present; 1 = at least one REQUIRED check
# failed; 2 = could not run (not in a git repo). Warnings never change the exit code.
#
# Deliberately does NOT source scripts/gate-lib.sh (lode-pcee expects the reason
# stated): this is a human-facing preflight, not a pipeline gate. Nothing consumes
# its exit code, so the `GATE COULD NOT RUN:` banner and the --no-advisory sentinel
# would be addressed to a caller that does not exist. The 0/1/2 numbering matches
# the gate contract on purpose, so the two never mean opposite things.
