# End-of-pass local worktree + branch GC for /land. The ONLY local reclaim in a
# pass: there is no per-ticket removal step.
#
# WHY A SCRIPT. This was ~80 lines of destructive shell (worktree remove --force,
# branch -D) fenced inside .claude/skills/land/SKILL.md, where nothing
# lint-checked it and only a markdown scanner could assert anything about it. It
# performs the most dangerous operations in the harness, so it belongs where it
# can be shellcheck'd and unit-tested.
#
# THE CONTRACT. Any worktree under .claude/worktrees/ that is UNLOCKED, CLEAN,
# and EITHER has not diverged from trunk OR -- if branch-attached -- has not
# diverged from its own branch's origin counterpart, is reclaimable, whoever
# made it. The second arm exists because an escalated ticket's reviewer
# worktree never merges by definition; content pushed to origin/land/<id> is
# captured just as safely.
#
# The per-candidate decision lives in "$TOP/scripts/worktree-gc-classify.sh". What lives
# HERE is what a side-effect-free classifier cannot own: reading the porcelain,
# resolving a stale lock (a real mutation), and the two destructive calls the
# classifier only ever recommends.
#
# WHY THE DIRTY CHECK EXISTS ON TOP OF THE ANCESTRY ARMS. A worktree freshly
# branched off trunk is trivially "merged" by zero divergence, so that proxy
# reads TRUE for a live, uncommitted build the instant it is created (lode-oqr).
# An unguarded zero-divergence read once destroyed two builds' uncommitted work
# outright. A dirty tree is never reclaimed, regardless of lock state or ancestry.
#
# ONE UNENFORCED COUPLING keeps this reclaiming anything at all: .gitignore. A
# finished worktree is full of untracked build junk (venv/, .nox/, __pycache__/)
# and reads clean ONLY because those are ignored. Un-ignore one and every
# worktree reads dirty and this sweep silently reclaims NOTHING.
#
# Usage: scripts/worktree-gc-sweep.sh
# Exit codes: 0 = swept (summary on stdout), 2 = machine fault / wrong checkout.
#
# NO --base-ref FLAG (lode-0867). An earlier revision accepted one, but it
# governed backstop 3's `git branch --merged` ONLY -- it never reached the
# worktree sweep (that decision belongs to scripts/worktree-gc-classify.sh,
# which takes no base ref and hardcodes `trunk`, a character-for-character port
# of the condition this loop used when it lived in a markdown fence) or
# backstop 2 (which keys off remote existence, no base ref at all). Passing
# anything but `trunk` would therefore have judged bare builder refs against
# one branch while every `worktree remove --force` still judged against
# `trunk` -- two different notions of "captured" inside one destructive pass.
# lode has exactly one default branch, no non-test caller ever passed a
# non-default value, and the flag was never anything but a carry-over from
# harness-export (whose call site passes `--base-ref main`); it was dropped
# rather than threaded through to the classifier (option (a) of lode-0867's
# decision). `trunk` is now a literal at the one site that ever consumed it.
#
# Not sourced from scripts/gate-lib.sh, though the "GATE COULD NOT RUN" banner
# below is that library's: same abstention as scripts/assert-main-checkout.sh
# makes, for the same reason -- gate-lib.sh's exit 2 means "could not judge the
# CONTENT", and this is a sweep with a precondition guard, not a content gate.
