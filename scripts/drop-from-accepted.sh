# Remove a branch AND every branch stacked on it from /land's accepted set.
#
# THE INVARIANT THIS ENFORCES (Section 3a): "a base that leaves the merge set
# takes its dependents with it." Ordering the set up front is not sufficient,
# because a base can drop OUT later -- kicked back on a real merge conflict, or
# bounced during isolation. If it does and its dependents stay, the loop merges
# a dependent whose base is no longer landing, putting the departed base's
# un-landed, just-rejected content onto trunk under the DEPENDENT's ticket
# name.
#
# WHY A SCRIPT. This was a shell recipe written inside a COMMENT in
# .claude/skills/land/SKILL.md -- a `grep -vxF`/`mv` pair the agent was
# expected to implement inline, plus a transitive dependent lookup it had to
# do by hand, at the exact moment a conflict had just fired. Detection was
# made executable (scripts/stacked-graph.sh, lode-s9xe.2); leaving the ACTION
# as prose is the half of the fix that actually decides what reaches trunk.
#
# THE REDUCTION MUST BE WRITTEN TO THE FILE, not just to the caller's shell
# variable: the isolation-replay loop re-reads the file, and would otherwise
# re-merge a branch this pass already kicked back.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/drop-from-accepted.sh <id> --accepted <file> [--graph <file>]
#
#   <id>         the branch leaving the merge set
#   --accepted   /land's ordered accepted-set file, rewritten in place
#   --graph      scripts/stacked-graph.sh output. Omit only when the pass has
#                no stacked branches at all; omitting it when there ARE stacks
#                silently skips the dependent drop, which is the whole point.
#
# Output (stdout), one per line, in the order they were removed:
#   DROPPED <id>      the branch named on the command line
#   HELD    <id>      a dependent removed with it -- the caller owes each of
#                     these a HELD note; they are not conflicted and not
#                     rejected, they simply have no foundation this pass.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = reduction applied (or the id was already absent, which is
# idempotent and fine), 2 = machine fault. There is no exit 1: removing a branch
# from a set is not a verdict about it.
