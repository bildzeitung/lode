# PreToolUse(Bash) guard body (lode-ij24): deny a Bash call that creates a bd
# ticket with `--deps blocks:<id>`, which INVERTS the edge -- it makes <id>
# blocked_by the NEW ticket, not the reverse. The correct form is two steps:
# create with no --deps, then `bd dep add <new-id> <id> --type blocks`.
#
# Usage: scripts/bd-deps-blocks-guard.sh '<bash command string>'
#
# Prints nothing (allow) or one PreToolUse hookSpecificOutput JSON object with
# permissionDecision "deny" -- same contract as the lode-o29m/lode-fpmi guards.
# ALWAYS exits 0: a PreToolUse hook exiting non-zero is itself a defect.
#
# Extracted from .claude/settings.json (lode-fpmi's acceptance criterion, applied
# to the remaining two inline guards: "the guard logic lives in a tested script,
# not untested inline shell" -- ungated inline shell in config is where this repo
# has already shipped silent undetected-for-months bugs, lode-mh9g / lode-54mo).
# Behaviour is unchanged by the extraction; tests/test_bd_deps_guard.py drives
# both this script and the shipped wrapper.
#
# NOTE: this file may use bash-only syntax -- it runs under `bash "$SCRIPT"`, not
# under the harness's dash /bin/sh. The WRAPPER in settings.json is what must stay
# POSIX (lode-9gm2), and its test pins that.
