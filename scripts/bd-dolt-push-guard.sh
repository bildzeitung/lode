# Backstop guard for scripts/bd-dolt-push.sh (lode-fzau): refuse to publish a
# suspicious local bd DB over refs/dolt/data.
#
# Background: a code-reviewer/coding launch worktree was observed with a
# STRAY, worktree-local bd DB (a fresh .beads/embeddeddolt, bootstrap-hydrated
# from that branch's committed, passively-lagging .beads/issues.jsonl) instead
# of resolving to the ONE shared main-checkout DB. A bd write against a ticket
# that happened to exist in that stale jsonl snapshot would have succeeded
# SILENTLY against the stray DB, and `bd-dolt-push.sh` would then have
# published that ~245-issue stale DB over refs/dolt/data, REVERTING ~159
# issues of real state cross-machine.
#
# A live diagnostic (see lode-fzau's notes) could NOT reproduce the stray-DB
# mechanism itself -- 10 separate probes, including a live re-run of the
# ticket's own repro steps, all resolved to the ONE shared, authoritative DB.
# So this is deliberately a BACKSTOP against a mechanism that is real (it
# happened once, with a concrete transcript) but not understood, not a fix for
# a reproduced defect. It is scoped to `bd-dolt-push.sh` -- the chokepoint that
# actually publishes cross-machine -- not to every bd write, which would be a
# much larger surface with much more false-positive exposure for comparatively
# little extra safety (a write landing on a stray DB cannot reach any OTHER
# machine until something publishes it).
#
# Two limits of that scope, both accepted and recorded in docs/decisions.md
# (lode-fzau) -- do not "discover" either one as a bug:
#   - `bd-dolt-push.sh` is the main publisher, not the only one: /challenge
#     calls `bd dolt push` directly as a DELIBERATE exemption from the wrapper
#     (lode-bpl -- it is human-invoked and interactive, so a failed push is seen
#     in the transcript). Those publishes are unguarded, by choice.
#   - This guard covers publishing a stale DB, NOT the incident's other harm: a
#     label swap that silently succeeds against a stray DB strands a ticket
#     invisibly to /land, with no push involved at all. Tracked as lode-zz7x.
#
# Refuses (non-zero exit, message on stderr) when EITHER:
#
#   1. The resolved `.beads` directory (via `bd where --json`) contains
#      `.auto-import-issues.jsonl` -- bd's own marker that the local DB was
#      bootstrap-hydrated from a passive jsonl snapshot rather than built up
#      via ordinary dolt-native writes/pulls. This is exactly what the
#      documented incident showed, and CLAUDE.md already treats a jsonl
#      import as never a legitimate substitute for `bd dolt pull` ("import
#      only upserts and silently misses deletions").
#
#   2. The current issue count (`bd count --json`) is below
#      BD_DOLT_PUSH_GUARD_MIN_RATIO_PCT percent (default 90) of a local,
#      per-DB-path high-water-mark cache file that `bd-dolt-push.sh` itself
#      writes immediately after every successful push. This is a network-free
#      proxy for "wildly below the remote's count": our own last
#      confirmed-pushed count is a hard floor, since the real remote can only
#      have grown (or stayed level) since -- it never requires contacting the
#      remote on top of what the push itself already needs.
#
# Deliberately does NOT false-positive on a fresh clone / `bd init`:
#   - `bd init` never calls this script or `bd-dolt-push.sh`.
#   - `bd init` restores state via `bd dolt pull`, never a jsonl import, so it
#     creates no `.auto-import-issues.jsonl` marker.
#   - A freshly-initialized DB has no high-water-mark cache file yet at its
#     resolved path, so check 2 has no baseline to compare against and does
#     not fire (a missing cache is "unknown", not "suspicious").
#
# Fails OPEN (does not block) if `bd where`/`bd count` themselves cannot be
# read -- the underlying `bd dolt push` will surface that failure on its own,
# and blocking here on an unrelated bd hiccup would risk bricking an otherwise
# legitimate push.
#
# Escape hatch: BD_DOLT_PUSH_GUARD_FORCE=1 skips both checks (loudly, on
# stderr) for the rare deliberate case -- disaster recovery, an intentional
# bulk prune immediately followed by a push.
#
# Usage: scripts/bd-dolt-push-guard.sh
# Env overrides: BD_DOLT_PUSH_GUARD_MIN_RATIO_PCT (default 90; must be a
#                  non-negative integer -- a malformed value REFUSES the push
#                  rather than silently skipping the check, see below)
#                BD_DOLT_PUSH_GUARD_FORCE (bypasses both checks; the falsy
#                  spellings 0/false/no/off are NOT a bypass, so writing
#                  "don't force" cannot silently mean the opposite)
#
# This script writes nothing at all -- it only reads. The high-water-mark cache
# it consults is written by bd-dolt-push.sh after a real successful push.

# typo. (Malformed input was also INCONSISTENT: '90%' exited 0/allowed, while
# 'abc' tripped `set -u` and exited 1/blocked.) Mirrors the same fail-closed
# rule bd-dolt-push.sh already applies to a non-numeric BD_DOLT_PUSH_MAX_ATTEMPTS
