# Discards working-tree churn to the beads passive exports by checking them
# back out of HEAD. Called from the `Stop` hook in `.claude/settings.json`,
# extracted out of that JSON string so the relpaths live in exactly one place:
# `scripts/beads-passive-exports.txt` (lode-do3q; docs/decisions.md has the why).
#
# Usage: discard-beads-passive-export-churn.sh <repo-root>
#
# Best-effort hygiene, NOT a gate -- every failure mode is swallowed and the
# script always exits 0, so it can never fail the Stop hook itself. Its
# fail-loud counterpart is scripts/worktree-gc-classify.sh, which reads the
# same list.
