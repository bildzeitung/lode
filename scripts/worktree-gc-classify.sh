#
# Pure, side-effect-free classification of ONE `.claude/worktrees/` candidate
# into the bucket `/land`'s Section 4 worktree-GC backstop sweep uses to
# decide what to do with it (lode-9owc).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: lode-yrtu added TWO new safety-critical predicates to that
# sweep in one change and treated them differently -- the stale-lock check was
# extracted to scripts/worktree-lock-stale.sh with a real unit-test suite
# (tests/test_worktree_lock_stale.py, 9 cases against real processes and real
# /proc, no mocking), matching the shape of scripts/recycled-worktree-guard.sh
# (lode-ivth) and scripts/isolation-guard.sh -- but the DIR-ONLY RECLAIM
# predicate (branch shape + age-since-last-commit + the lode-9hgu dirty-tree
# guard, gating a `git worktree remove --force` that DESTROYS a directory) was
# left as inline bash in a markdown fence, with no mechanical coverage at all.
# lode-ivth's own rationale applies verbatim here: shell embedded in a
# markdown fence gets neither shellcheck nor a unit test. This script gives
# the whole per-candidate decision -- not just the dir-only arm -- exactly
# that coverage; see tests/test_worktree_gc_classify.py.
#
# SCOPE: this script decides; it never acts. The two DESTRUCTIVE calls
# (`git worktree remove --force`, `git branch -D`) stay inline in
# `.claude/skills/land/SKILL.md` Section 4, which is also the only place that
# ever resolves a STALE lock (via scripts/worktree-lock-stale.sh +
# `git worktree unlock`) -- a real mutation, so it cannot live in a script
# whose entire contract is "no side effects." By the time SKILL.md calls this
# script, any stale lock has already been resolved and unlocked; the <locked>
# argument below reflects that resolution, not the raw porcelain bit.
#
# Usage:
#   worktree-gc-classify.sh <worktree-path> <head-sha> <locked:0|1> \
#                            <branch-name> <min-age-seconds>
#
#   <worktree-path>    the candidate's path, e.g. .claude/worktrees/agent-abc
#                       (as `git worktree list --porcelain` printed it).
#   <head-sha>         its HEAD commit sha.
#   <locked:0|1>        1 if `git worktree lock` currently, GENUINELY holds it
#                       -- i.e. the caller has already run it through
#                       scripts/worktree-lock-stale.sh and, if stale, has
#                       already `git worktree unlock`-ed it and is passing 0
#                       here instead. This script performs no staleness check
#                       and no unlock itself.
#   <branch-name>       the branch checked out in the worktree, or "" if the
#                       worktree is DETACHED. Passed as its own argv element
#                       (never parsed out of a shared tab-delimited string),
#                       so an empty branch can never shift a later field --
#                       the hazard SKILL.md's own field-order comment warns
#                       about for its porcelain `read` is structurally absent
#                       here.
#   <min-age-seconds>   the dir-only reclaim age floor -- SKILL.md derives
#                       this once from `${LAND_WORKTREE_DIRONLY_MIN_AGE_SECONDS
#                       :-21600}` and passes the resolved number through, so
#                       the tunable's one documented home
#                       (docs/agents-workflow.md, not configuration.md per
#                       that page's own scope note) is unchanged.
#
# Must run with cwd inside the git repo whose `trunk` and `origin/*` refs are
# being judged -- exactly where /land's Section 4 loop already runs from (the
# main checkout root).
#
# Prints exactly one bucket name to stdout and exits 0:
#
#   full-reclaim    HEAD is CAPTURED -- merged into `trunk`, or (for a
#                   branch-attached worktree) an ancestor of its own
#                   `origin/<branch>` counterpart (lode-amif; `${br%%--*}`
#                   strips the lode-em6v worktree-uniqueness suffix first) --
#                   AND the tree is provably clean. Caller may
#                   `git worktree remove --force` AND `git branch -D` the
#                   branch.
#   dir-only        NOT captured, but <branch-name> matches `worktree-agent-*`
#                   (a builder's own branch, never pushed to origin -- lode-
#                   yrtu), its last commit is at least <min-age-seconds> old,
#                   and the tree is provably clean. Caller may remove the
#                   DIRECTORY only -- never the branch ref, which is the only
#                   place its commits stay reachable.
#   keep-locked     <locked> was 1. Caller must not touch this worktree.
#   keep-notmerged  NOT captured, and either <branch-name> doesn't match
#                   `worktree-agent-*` at all (a `land/<id>`-branched
#                   reviewer/rebase-pickup worktree, a detached worktree --
#                   empty <branch-name> can never match the glob, anything
#                   else) or it does but its last commit is too young (or its
#                   timestamp is unreadable) -- fails SAFE, keep. Caller must
#                   not touch it.
#   keep-dirty      Otherwise eligible for full-reclaim or dir-only, but the
#                   tree is not PROVABLY clean -- including when
#                   `git -C <worktree-path> status --porcelain` itself errors
#                   (a vanished directory, corrupt worktree admin, ...),
#                   which fails CLOSED into this bucket rather than ever
#                   risking `--force` on a worktree that could not even be
#                   read. Caller must not touch it.
#
# Exit 2 -- usage error (wrong argument count). Never a verdict about the
#           worktree.
#
# NO BEHAVIOUR CHANGE (lode-9owc acceptance criterion): every branch below is
# a direct port of SKILL.md Section 4's own inline logic -- same ancestry
# arms, same dirty-tree exclude list, same age floor, same branch-shape
# `case`. Do not "improve" the ordering or the exclude list here without
# updating the loop's own long-standing comments alongside it (they still
# hold the fuller historical rationale for each choice: lode-h1vn, lode-amif,
# lode-9hgu, lode-yrtu, lode-bns3).
