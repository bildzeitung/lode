# Select the SemVer-greatest `vX.Y.Z` git tag (NOT simply the most recently
# created one), and optionally check whether a candidate version strictly
# exceeds it, for /release's Section 1 tag lookup
# (.claude/skills/release/SKILL.md#1-find-the-latest-tag) and
# scripts/release.sh's tag-monotonicity gate.
#
# Extracted per lode-b2bf: this exact tag-selection loop + version_gt()
# SemVer comparator used to be duplicated as raw, untested inline shell in
# BOTH .claude/skills/release/SKILL.md (~lines 32-57) and scripts/release.sh
# (~lines 67-86) -- free to drift between the two copies, meaning the skill
# could propose a bump against one baseline tag while release.sh's own
# monotonicity check ran against a DIFFERENT one. Same "ungated inline shell
# in a SKILL.md rots silently" lesson as scripts/release-bump.sh (lode-ns3r)
# and scripts/merge-precheck.sh (lode-mh9g).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/release-latest-tag.sh                 # print the latest vX.Y.Z tag (or nothing)
#   scripts/release-latest-tag.sh --gt VERSION     # exit 0 iff VERSION (bare X.Y.Z, no
#                                                   # leading 'v') is SemVer-strictly-greater
#                                                   # than the latest tag
#
# Mode 1 (no args): prints the latest matching tag to stdout WITH its
# leading "v" (e.g. "v1.2.0"), or prints nothing at all (empty stdout,
# still exit 0) when no `vX.Y.Z` tag exists yet -- that is the legitimate
# first-release answer, not a fault.
#
# Mode 2 (--gt VERSION): no stdout either way. Exit 0 means VERSION exceeds
# the latest tag, OR no tag exists at all (first release -- anything
# exceeds "nothing"). Exit 1 means it does not.
#
# Exit 2 in EITHER mode -> MACHINE FAULT (git failure, bad usage,
# malformed VERSION argument). Diagnostic to stderr, nothing to stdout --
# same "exit 2 is the machine, never the content" convention as
# scripts/release-bump.sh / scripts/merge-precheck.sh.
#
# Tag selection is SemVer-greatest, NOT most-recently-created: a tag can be
# created out of order (e.g. a backport release cut after a later one), so
# sorting `git tag -l` by name or creation date is not equivalent to sorting
# by SemVer value. Every candidate tag is compared NUMERICALLY
# component-by-component (never as a string), so multi-digit components
# compare correctly: v0.10.0 > v0.9.0. A tag is only a candidate at all if
# it is EXACTLY `vX.Y.Z` -- three all-numeric, dot-separated components and
# nothing else. This is stricter than the glob the inline snippets used
# (`[0-9]*.[0-9]*.[0-9]*`, a case pattern where the bare `*` matches ANY
# trailing text): that glob let "v1.2.3-rc1", "v1.2.3.4", and "v1.2.3beta"
# all through as if they were plain releases. Verified by hand while writing
# this script -- all three matched the old case pattern.
#
# Read-only: runs `git tag`, never touches the working tree, never writes bd.
