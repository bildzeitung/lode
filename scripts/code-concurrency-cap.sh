# stdout. Extracted per lode-54mo out of .claude/skills/code/SKILL.md, which
# used to embed this ~30-line derivation verbatim in the prompt -- ungated
# inline shell in a SKILL.md is exactly where this repo already shipped
# silent, undetected-for-months bugs (lode-mh9g's merge-tree snippet). This
# script is testable (tests/test_code_concurrency_cap.py); the SKILL.md
# prompt is not.
#
# THE FORMULA AND ITS MEASURED COEFFICIENTS ARE FROZEN HERE. This script does
# not retune anything -- full rationale, the measured memory table, and the
# re-measurement trigger for when the suite grows all live in
# docs/agents-workflow.md#concurrency-cap-lode-2cf; that doc's pseudo-code
# block is explanation and may lag, this script is the source of truth on any
# disagreement.

#
# LODE_CAP_MEMINFO / LODE_CAP_NPROC are TEST SEAMS, not tuning knobs. They let
# tests/test_code_concurrency_cap.py reach branches (meminfo absent, the
# by_cpu clamp dominating, floor-at-1) that are unreachable on whatever
# physical machine happens to run the suite. Do not set them to "tune" this
# script -- use LODE_CODE_MAX_CONCURRENT_AGENTS for that.
#
# Resolves its own repo root (like scripts/release.sh) rather than trusting
# the caller's cwd, since it reads noxfile.py by path.
