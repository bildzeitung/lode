# PreToolUse(Bash) guard body (lode-o29m/lode-9mbt): deny any `gh` invocation
# that does not match a small, explicit READ-ONLY allowlist -- DEFAULT-DENY,
# not a write-verb denylist (lode-9mbt). `gh` is authed as the user, so a
# false ALLOW spends the user's public identity irrecoverably (the
# notification already went out); a false DENY costs a reword. Full
# rationale: docs/agents-workflow.md ("Never write to an external tracker
# under the user's identity (lode-o29m)").
#
# Usage: scripts/gh-write-guard.sh '<bash command string>'
#
# Prints nothing (allow -- fall through to normal permission handling) or one
# PreToolUse hookSpecificOutput JSON object with permissionDecision "deny".
# ALWAYS exits 0: a PreToolUse hook exiting non-zero is itself a defect.
#
# Extracted from .claude/settings.json (mirroring scripts/sha-fabrication-guard.sh,
# lode-fpmi) so the scanning logic can be driven directly by
# tests/test_gh_write_guard.py, and so the quote-aware split below -- which
# needs bash array/substring primitives dash (the harness's actual PreToolUse
# interpreter, lode-9gm2) does not have -- has somewhere to live.
#
# NOTE: this file may use bash-only syntax -- it runs under `bash "$SCRIPT"`, not
# under the harness's dash /bin/sh. The WRAPPER in settings.json is what must stay
# POSIX (lode-9gm2), and its test pins that.
#
# QUOTE-AWARE SEGMENT SPLIT (lode-obox) and QUOTED-HEREDOC PRE-PASS (lode-d5je).
# The command is split into candidate "invocation segments" at shell
# control-operator characters (; & | ( ) { } `) so a `gh ...` phrase
# mid-command (after `&&`, inside `$(...)`, ...) is still caught at a command
# position -- and a quoted heredoc body (a commit-message worked example, a
# doc quoting real shell) is stripped first so it cannot manufacture a fake
# segment start either. Both primitives (`_split_unquoted`,
# `strip_quoted_heredoc_bodies`) now live in scripts/shell-quote-split.sh
# (lode-dia6), shared with scripts/sha-fabrication-guard.sh -- see that file's
# header for the full rationale, the false-positive shapes each fix closes,
# and the fail-open residuals each deliberately accepts. Differential and
# mutation coverage for both: tests/test_gh_write_guard.py.

# This guard runs on EVERY Bash tool call, and the split + five greps below cost
# ~45ms each time -- but the quote-aware _split_unquoted char loop below them
# (lode-obox) is O(n^2), so a plain `*gh*` substring test here is far too loose
# a gate: it lets through any LONG command that merely contains "gh" inside an
# ordinary word (through/highlight/night/eight/brought/high/light/straight --
# i.e. most commit messages, `bd update --notes`, and heredoc prose this repo
# writes constantly), paying the O(n^2) cost on gh-free text (lode-vrhu:
# measured 469ms-3.5s on an 8-25 KB command containing "through", vs ~3ms for a
# command without "gh" anywhere at all).
#
# Tightened to a command-POSITION test: `gh` must be preceded by start-of-string
# or a non-identifier character, and followed by whitespace. This is NOT a
# narrowing of the deny surface (lode-obox's binding human decision requires its
# own argument for that, so it gets one): P below -- the regex that actually
# decides what counts as a `gh` command position -- only ever matches `gh`
# preceded by start-of-string, whitespace, or a literal `/` (the sole optional
# path-prefix group, which itself must end in `/`), and always followed
# immediately by whitespace (every alternative in P's grammar reduces to
# `gh(...)?[[:space:]]+`, and the optional flag-group repetition, when present,
# itself starts with whitespace). Every segment START `_split_unquoted` can ever
# produce is a shell control character (`;&|(){}\``, or `$(` inside double
# quotes) -- itself non-alnum-non-underscore -- or the string start. So every
# position P could ever match already satisfies this test; the pre-filter
# cannot skip a case P would have caught. Verified against every DENIED case in
# tests/test_gh_write_guard.py at both script and hook level: zero deny-side
# regressions (lode-vrhu).
#
# CASE-INSENSITIVE (`[Gg][Hh]`), deliberately, and NOT the old `*gh*` filter's
# case-sensitivity. Every grep below runs `-i`, so P really does match `GH `/`Gh `
# at a command position; a case-SENSITIVE pre-filter would therefore skip a case P
# would have caught -- exactly the narrowing this block claims not to do. Measured
# differentially during review: with a lowercase `gh` present incidentally
# elsewhere, `git commit -m "walking through" ; GH issue create --title x` went
# DENY (old filter) -> ALLOW (case-sensitive tightened filter). The old filter's
# behaviour on this axis was incoherent rather than protective -- a STANDALONE
# `GH issue create` was already allowed by it, since the command contains no
# lowercase `gh` at all -- so matching it exactly would have preserved an
# accidental half-catch and dropped the other half. Matching P's own case-folding
# instead makes the pre-filter a strict superset of P in both directions: nothing
# P can catch is skipped, and the one behaviour change versus trunk is
# allow -> DENY on a standalone uppercase invocation (the conservative direction,
# and a live write on a case-insensitive filesystem).
