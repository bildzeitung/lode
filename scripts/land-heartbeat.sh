# Re-stamp (or release) the single-lander lock using THIS pass's own token.
# (lode-s9xe.1)
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The token read-back was six lines of boilerplate repeated at
# seven sites in .claude/skills/land/SKILL.md -- read the token file, warn if
# empty, call land-lock.sh -- and a coverage gate had to check that every one of
# the seven carried its warning, because paraphrasing one silently dropped it
# out of coverage. One script means one copy to get right.
#
# The token lives in a FILE beside the lock, not a variable: no shell state
# survives between the skill's separate Bash invocations, and it sits outside
# $STATE_DIR because Section 1's per-pass scratch wipe would otherwise delete it
# mid-pass. It is lock state, not per-pass scratch.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/land-heartbeat.sh                  # re-stamp (best effort, never fails the pass)
#   scripts/land-heartbeat.sh --release        # release at a normal end-of-pass exit
#
# Exit codes: always 0 on the heartbeat path -- lock bookkeeping must never stop
# a pass that is otherwise fine. --release propagates land-lock.sh's own status
# so a caller can report a failed release, but no caller is required to act.
# The ONE exception is exit 2, a usage error: same reservation land-lock.sh
# makes, for the same reason. A mistyped flag (`--relase`) must not quietly
# degrade a release into a heartbeat -- that leaves the lock held for the whole
# staleness window while the caller's exit status says everything went fine.

# Sibling resolution is `$(dirname "$0")`, the same idiom scripts/land-merge-one.sh
# uses for every script it shells out to -- NOT a repo-graph lookup. The upstream
# template reached for `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` here; going through the repo
# graph to find a file that is literally next to this one buys nothing, and it
# forced every test to plant a copy of land-lock.sh inside its throwaway repo.

# the `--git-dir` path, so the reader has to look where the writer put it. The two
# resolve identically in the main checkout, which is the only place /land runs
# (scripts/assert-main-checkout.sh). Harmonizing the pair onto --git-common-dir is
# follow-up work and must move the writer and this reader together -- changing one
# alone silently orphans the token.
