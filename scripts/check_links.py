"""Verify every relative markdown link in every tracked *.md file resolves
(lode-dkdg, widened repo-wide by lode-act5).

docs/ leans heavily on deep cross-document anchors (decisions.md alone points
into stack.md, externals.md, editing.md, agents-workflow.md), but GitHub's
anchor slugs are derived from heading TEXT -- so rewording a heading silently
breaks every inbound link, with nothing failing to report it. This gate walks
every tracked ``*.md`` file in the repo (originally just ``docs/`` and
``.claude/``; widened repo-wide by lode-act5 -- see SCOPE DECISION
(lode-act5) below), resolves each relative markdown link's target file, and
-- for a ``#anchor`` link -- checks the anchor against the target file's
headings, slugged the same way GitHub slugs them.

CONCRETE EVIDENCE this already happens in trunk (found by an ad-hoc slug
check before this gate existed): ``docs/decisions.md`` carried a dead anchor
into ``agents-workflow.md#the-landing-loop--build-review-land-planned`` --
the heading had been reworded to drop "(planned)" and nothing reported it.
That case is captured verbatim in ``tests/test_check_links.py`` as a
regression lock on the slug algorithm itself.

Usage::

    python scripts/check_links.py            # scan every tracked *.md file + every other tracked file
    python scripts/check_links.py --root DIR # scan a different tree (tests)

Exits 1 and prints one ``file:line: reason -> target`` line per broken link
(plus a summary count) on any broken file target or broken anchor; exits 0
and prints a short OK line otherwise.

Scope, deliberately: relative markdown links only -- external links
(``http(s)://``, ``mailto:``, etc.) are never resolvable against this repo
and are skipped; image links (``![alt](...)``) are out of scope (the
acceptance criteria is about cross-document *links*); an ``#anchor`` is only
checked against a target's headings when the target is itself a ``.md``
file -- a link into a non-markdown file (a script, a config) has no heading
model to check the anchor against, so only its file-existence is verified.

SCOPE DECISION (lode-v10i): a ``docs/`` anchor is cited from plenty of files
that are neither under ``docs/`` nor ``.claude/`` -- a bare-text pointer like
``docs/release.md#ci-workflow-trigger-scope-push-and-pull_request`` inside a
``# comment`` in ``.github/workflows/*.yml`` or ``scripts/*.sh``, with no
markdown ``[text](...)`` brackets at all. The general form was chosen over
special-casing ``.github/workflows/``: EVERY tracked file outside
``BARE_CITATION_EXCLUDE_DIRS`` is scanned for a bare ``docs/<path>.md#<anchor>``
text reference (``_bare_doc_anchor_refs`` / ``_tracked_other_files`` below),
not just workflow YAML -- ``scripts/``, ``noxfile.py`` and ``src/`` all cite
docs/ anchors the identical way, so special-casing one directory would have
left the others silently ungated again.

This second pass is deliberately narrower than the full bracketed-link walk:
it recognizes only a literal, root-relative ``docs/<path>.md#<anchor>``
substring -- the shape every real instance in this repo is written in,
regardless of the citing file's own directory depth.

SCOPE DECISION (lode-act5): what is now ``BARE_CITATION_EXCLUDE_DIRS``
originally bounded BOTH what got the full bracketed-link walk (``docs/`` +
``.claude/`` only) AND, inversely, what got the bare-citation pass above
(everything else). That meant a bracketed relative link --
``[text](../CLAUDE.md)``, say -- written in a tracked markdown file outside
that pair of directories (a top-level ``README.md``, ``tests/README.md``,
``AGENTS.md``, ...) was never resolved at all: it isn't a bare ``docs/...``
citation (so the second pass's regex doesn't match it), and the file wasn't
under ``docs/``/``.claude/`` (so the first pass never walked it). Found
concretely reviewing lode-s9xe.7: ``tests/README.md``'s
``[`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md)`` link was verified by hand, not by this gate.

Two ways to close it were on the table: widen the full walk to every tracked
``*.md`` file, or hand-maintain a named allowlist of top-level READMEs. The
general form won, consistent with the lode-v10i precedent above -- an
allowlist needs a human to remember to add every new top-level README (and
this repo already has several: the root, ``tests/``, ``.beads/``, plus
``specs/*.md`` and ``src/lode/eval/corpus/*.md``, all of which carry real
relative links today and are exactly the shape this gate exists to check),
where the general form costs nothing extra to maintain and catches the next
one automatically. ``_tracked_markdown_files`` below now returns every
tracked ``*.md`` file, repo-wide, for the full walk; ``_tracked_other_files``
(the bare-citation pass) is UNCHANGED -- still every tracked file outside
``BARE_CITATION_EXCLUDE_DIRS`` -- so a markdown file outside those two
directories now gets BOTH passes. That is deliberate, not an oversight: the
bare pass alone still catches a citation with no markdown brackets at all
(backtick-quoted prose, e.g. tests/README.md's `` `docs/conventions.md` ``
mentions), a shape the bracket walk cannot see. Where the two passes do
overlap -- a bracketed link into a ``docs/`` target, matched by both --
``check`` de-duplicates its result list, so one real break is still reported
exactly once.

RETIRED (lode-6e9c): once the full bracketed-link walk widened repo-wide
(lode-act5, above), the old ``SCAN_DIRS`` name stopped bounding any scan at
all -- its only surviving job was excluding ``docs/``/``.claude/`` from the
bare-citation pass, the opposite of what "scan dirs" suggests. Renamed to
``BARE_CITATION_EXCLUDE_DIRS`` to say what it actually does; nothing about
its VALUE or behavior changed, only the name. This also collapsed
``check()`` to a single ``git ls-files`` fork per call (both file sets are
now derived in memory from one fetch) and to reading each tracked markdown
file from disk at most once per call (the two passes share a text cache, so
a markdown file that both passes visit -- one outside
``BARE_CITATION_EXCLUDE_DIRS`` -- is read once, not twice).
