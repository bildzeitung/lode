"""Verify every Sphinx-style symbol-naming role -- ``:func:``, ``:class:``,
``:data:``, ``:meth:``, ``:attr:``, ``:mod:``, ``:exc:``, ``:obj:`` -- naming a
``lode.*`` symbol in a docstring or comment under ``src/`` or ``tests/``
resolves to a real, importable symbol (lode-8oeu).

Nothing gated this before: ``scripts/check_links.py`` is markdown-only. A
single rename (``lode-ekqh``, ``cited_answer._resolve_target`` ->
``_resolve_targets``) left FOUR dangling refs across two branches that
merged in the same ``/land`` pass (``lode-2hfd``), and only a hand sweep
caught them -- one of the four had never named a real symbol at all.

That same sweep found a second, independent defect class: refs
LINE-WRAPPED mid-role, e.g.::

    :func:`lode.cited_answer.
    _resolve_targets`

Sphinx cannot resolve a role containing a newline + indentation, so these
are already broken as cross-references regardless of whether the symbol
exists -- and they are invisible to the ``grep -rn <name>`` a rename
normally relies on, which is *exactly* how ``lode-2hfd``'s wrapped site was
missed. This gate normalizes intra-role whitespace before resolving (so a
wrapped-but-correct ref like the one above is not a false positive), and
separately reports every wrapped ref as its own finding.

SCOPE DECISION (recorded in ``docs/decisions.md``, lode-8oeu): only roles
naming a ``lode.*`` symbol are resolved. A role naming anything else (a
stdlib or third-party symbol, e.g. ``:func:`httpx.get```) is silently
skipped -- this repo's docstrings write those routinely, and there is no
value in this gate reasoning about symbols it doesn't own. This also
disposes of the ``~`` Sphinx "show only the last component" prefix cleanly:
it is stripped before the ``lode.`` prefix check, so ``:func:`~lode.cli.
_tabular_table``` is treated identically to the unprefixed form.

This scoping covers RESOLUTION only. The wrapped-role check below is
deliberately repo-wide: a role split across a line break is a syntax defect
that stops Sphinx resolving it and hides it from ``grep`` no matter who owns
the symbol, so ``:func:`httpx.<newline>get``` hard-fails too. Ownership is a
question about whether we can check a symbol exists; wrapping is not.

RESOLUTION ALGORITHM: a dotted path ``lode.cli._short_date`` is resolved by
importing the longest importable *module* prefix, then walking the
remaining dotted segments as attribute access from there. This is
deliberate, not incidental -- this repo's own convention is that a
``lode.mod.symbol`` ref names a MODULE-ATTRIBUTE path, not necessarily a
literal ``def``/``class`` site: ``lode.cli._short_date`` resolves because
``cli/__init__.py`` re-exports it via ``from lode.timestamps import
_short_date``-style imports, not because it is defined in ``cli/__init__.py``
itself. A plain "does this exact file define this exact name" check would
reject every such re-exported ref as a false positive.

WRAPPED-REF DISPOSITION (lode-hg49, amends lode-8oeu's original warn-only
call): the 81 pre-existing wrapped sites (lode-8oeu's widened role set) were
mechanically unwrapped in one pass -- prose-only, no behavior change, every
formerly-wrapped ref still resolves identically since the normalize step was
already collapsing its whitespace before resolving. With the backlog at
zero, this gate now HARD-FAILS on any wrapped role, same as an unresolved
one -- see ``docs/decisions.md`` for the recorded reasoning behind the
warn-then-unwrap-then-hard-fail sequencing.

``docs/decisions.md``'s own append-only exemption from pointer sweeps does
not interact with this gate at all: this gate only ever reads ``src/`` and
``tests/`` Python source, never ``docs/`` prose.
