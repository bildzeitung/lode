# Sourceable helpers for scripts/update-deps.sh's VERSION DIFF and the filing
# decision for its churn-evaluation stub ticket (lode-i642). Extracted so the
# parsing, the rendering and the noise gate are covered by `nox -s shellcheck`
# and tests/test_dep_churn_lib.py -- the same shape scripts/venv-install.sh,
# scripts/gate-lib.sh and scripts/shell-quote-split.sh already use.
#
# CONTRACT: every function here returns its data on STDOUT and holds no
# cross-call state. Callers assign the result themselves. That is deliberate
# and load-bearing -- see docs/stack.md: update-deps.sh consumes these through
# command substitution, which runs in a subshell, so a function that "returned"
# a value by setting a global would have it silently discarded.
#
# No side effects, no top-level statements: safe to source from anywhere.

# name<TAB>version for every pin in the lock file $1, on stdout. Deliberately
# ignores the --hash lines; those are the whole reason this isn't `git diff`.
