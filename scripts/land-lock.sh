# Single-lander lock for /land (lode-aps3), extracted out of an inline
# Section 0 snippet in .claude/skills/land/SKILL.md that relied on
# `trap 'rm -f "$LOCK"' EXIT` to release the lock at the end of a /land pass.
#
# THE BUG THIS REPLACES: an agent running this skill executes every fenced
# `bash` block as its own, separate Bash tool invocation -- nothing carries
# over between them (the governing rule at the top of SKILL.md: "no fenced
# block may depend on shell state from another", lode-sfnb). A `trap ... EXIT`
# set inside Section 0's block fires the instant THAT block's shell exits --
# which is before Section 1 even runs, not at the end of the pass. The lock
# was therefore held for the duration of one Bash call, not the pass it was
# supposed to serialize (VERIFIED LIVE 2026-07-27, bd show lode-aps3).
#
# It failed doubly open: the old reclaim path checked `kill -0 $OWNER_PID`
# against the PID recorded by whichever block last wrote the lock file. In
# this per-block-invocation architecture that check is not merely broken, it
# is STRUCTURALLY MEANINGLESS -- a Bash tool invocation's shell process has,
# by definition, already exited by the time a LATER invocation runs (control
# only returns to the caller once the shell exits), so `$OWNER_PID` recorded
# by any prior block is *always* dead by the time a later block reads it,
# whether or not a /land pass is still genuinely in progress (just running a
# later block/section). PID liveness cannot distinguish "the pass is still
# running, just between Bash calls" from "the pass crashed" here.
#
# THE FIX: no trap, no PID-liveness check. Liveness is instead a wall-clock
# STALENESS TOKEN -- the lock records when it was acquired, and a later
# `acquire` reclaims it only once that timestamp is older than
# LAND_LOCK_STALE_SECONDS (default 1800s / 30min -- see CAVEAT 1 for why the
# `heartbeat` subcommand did NOT buy a reduction). This staleness reclaim is
# the SOLE mechanism that is guaranteed to release an abandoned lock: it needs
# no cooperation from any
# particular exit site, so it cannot be silently broken by a future editor
# adding a new "stop the pass" exit to SKILL.md and forgetting to release.
# SKILL.md also calls `release` explicitly at two sites (Section 1's
# empty-queue exit, the end of Section 4) purely to keep the common
# `/loop 5m /land` cadence tight; MANY other exits reach neither and wait out
# the TTL instead -- see the two caveats below, and
# docs/agents-workflow.md's single-lander-lock bullet, which is the design
# home for this mechanism and for LAND_LOCK_STALE_SECONDS.
#
# CAVEAT 1 -- the TTL measures IDLE time rather than acquisition age ACROSS
# THE TWO LOOPS the `heartbeat` subcommand brackets (lode-m87j), and
# acquisition age everywhere else. Read the gap list below before relying on
# the idle-time reading. Previously nothing re-stamped the
# token mid-pass, so the window had to exceed the TOTAL wall-clock duration of
# the longest legitimate pass (N land-review Opus dispatches, a combined
# re-gate, per-branch isolation replay on red, `validate-mermaid.sh`'s docker
# run, `lock_currency`'s network resolve) -- summed across the WHOLE pass, not
# merely the longest gap between two Bash calls. A pass that genuinely ran
# longer than the window had its own lock reclaimed by the next tick,
# mid-`trunk`-merge -- the dangerous direction -- which is why the window is
# large (1800s) and has never been reduced.
#
# `heartbeat` re-stamps the SAME record `acquire` wrote, with no atomicity
# contest (see its own comment below) -- so as long as SOMETHING calls it
# periodically during a pass, the token's age never reflects more than the
# GAP since the last call, not the pass's total duration. FOUR call sites make
# that periodic, by construction rather than by a future editor remembering a
# new one per section (the exact rot this design has avoided from the start):
#   - `.claude/skills/land/SKILL.md`, right before Section 1a (lode-v4sv) --
#     fires once per pass, immediately after Section 1's two networked calls
#     (`bd dolt pull`, `git fetch origin`) and immediately before Section 1a's
#     O(n^2) stacked-branch-graph computation, so that O(n^2) work sits
#     between this call and the next (Section 2a's, below) rather than
#     unheartbeated all the way from `acquire`.
#   - `.claude/skills/land/SKILL.md` Section 2a (the top of the per-ticket
#     "vet each branch" loop) -- fires once per ticket, immediately before
#     that ticket's `land-review` Opus dispatch (2c), bounding that gap to
#     roughly one dispatch's duration, not the sum of N.
#   - `scripts/land-merge-one.sh` (lode-sfnb) -- fires on every invocation,
#     which covers both Section 3's first merge loop (once per accepted
#     branch) AND its isolation-replay copy (once per branch being re-tested
#     after a red combined re-gate) with a single call site inside the
#     script, needing no second SKILL.md edit for the replay loop.
#   - `.claude/skills/land/SKILL.md`, at the top of Section 4's main block
#     (lode-v4sv) -- fires once per pass, right after `git push origin trunk`
#     and before the per-ticket `bd close` loop, so every per-ticket `bd
#     close` / `epic-completion-check.sh` / the networked
#     `scripts/bd-dolt-push.sh` / every per-ticket branch delete / the
#     worktree-GC sweep sits between this call and the pass-end `release`,
#     rather than unheartbeated all the way from the LAST `land-merge-one.sh`
#     call in Section 3.
# All four are pinned by tests the same way `acquire`/`release` are (see
# tests/test_land_lock.py and tests/test_land_merge_one.py) -- a heartbeat
# call site that quietly stops being called is exactly as dangerous as the
# original inert lock, just slower to notice.
#
# ONE stretch of a pass remains uncovered post-lode-v4sv (down from three) --
# the four call sites above bracket the two per-ticket LOOPS plus the two
# named boundary points, not literally every line of the pass. Do not read
# "heartbeat exists" as "the whole pass is covered" (lode-m87j's technical
# review; the ticket's own design note named only this one):
#   1. Section 3's single COMBINED re-gate (`nox -t fix && nox -s tests &&
#      nox -s lock_currency`, plus `validate-mermaid.sh` on a docs change),
#      which runs once, between the merge loop and the isolation-replay loop.
#      MEASURED on the 2026-07-28 dev machine at ~60s total (tests ~50s, fix
#      ~0.4s, lock_currency ~1s, mermaid ~10s) -- comfortably small, but it is
#      wall-clock on one machine, not a bound. Unlike the two gaps lode-v4sv
#      closed, this one does NOT grow with the size of the `ready-for-land`
#      queue -- it runs exactly once per pass regardless of how many tickets
#      are being landed -- which is why it was left uncovered rather than
#      folded into this ticket; re-deriving whether it is worth a call site of
#      its own is a separate decision, not implied by this one.
#
# lode-v4sv (2026-08-07) closed the other two of the original three -- both of
# which DID grow with queue size, unlike the one above -- by adding the first
# and fourth call sites listed above. Neither new call site individually
# BOUNDS the per-pass-or-per-ticket work it sits in front of (each is a single
# interval, not itself a per-iteration heartbeat re-fired inside Section 1a's
# loop or inside Section 4's per-ticket loops) -- what it buys is isolating
# that work as the SOLE remaining contributor to its stretch, rather than
# that work summed with adjacent networked/fixed-cost calls. This does not
# change LAND_LOCK_STALE_SECONDS and must not be read as though it does --
# see "WHY THE DEFAULT STAYS AT 1800s" below, unchanged by this ticket.
#
# WHY THE DEFAULT STAYS AT 1800s. The heartbeat shrinks the exposure a lot: it
# is the whole fix for "a long pass has its OWN lock reclaimed mid-merge", and
# at 1800s that failure is now essentially unreachable. It does NOT license
# lowering the window, because the two failure directions remain as asymmetric
# as they were before it existed: too LOW reclaims a live lock and puts two
# landers on `trunk` at once (unbounded damage), while too HIGH only delays
# landing by a few `/loop 5m` ticks (bounded, self-healing, and explicitly not
# latency-critical). Lowering trades the safe side for the dangerous one, and
# nothing here measures the binding gap. That gap is NOT the re-gate above: it
# is one `land-review` Opus dispatch (the 2a->2a interval) plus, on a bounce,
# the lander's own `bd` bookkeeping. Agent dispatches in this repo are
# routinely minutes long -- lode-m87j's own `coding` builder took 14m10s
# (bd `started_at` 03:00:24Z -> `updated_at` 03:14:34Z, 2026-07-28) -- i.e.
# the same order of magnitude as a 600s window, not comfortably under it. So
# the reduction to 600s that this subcommand was expected to unlock is held
# back until either the gaps above are covered or a real distribution of
# `land-review` dispatch times exists to size it against; see lode-cp4o.
# Overriding via the env var stays available for anyone who has measured
# their own machine.
#
# CAVEAT 2 -- the stale-lock RECLAIM (and the fresh-vs-reclaim race beside
# it) is now closed OUTRIGHT via `flock(1)` (lode-y3dw), not merely narrowed.
#
# READ THE EXPOSURE FIRST, or this will read as far more urgent than it is.
# Under the documented operating convention -- ONE `/loop 5m /land` on one
# machine -- acquires are issued SERIALLY, and a pass that is still running
# holds a FRESH lock. So the reclaim branch is crash-recovery only: reaching
# it concurrently at all needs two independent /land invocations arriving
# within milliseconds of each other, 30+ minutes after a crash. This is
# hardening against the convention being violated.
#
# HISTORY, for whoever finds this via a bisect or a stale mental model. Two
# prior fixes (lode-ao95, lode-78ih) serialized reclaim behind an `mkdir`-based
# gate (`$LOCK.reclaiming`) with a self-heal, plus a gate-ownership re-check
# immediately before the destructive `rm -f "$LOCK"`. That closed the original
# two-step race and the alive-but-stalled-holder displacement it left open,
# but a live evaluation (lode-y3dw) MEASURED two further, STALL-FREE routes
# into the same two-winner outcome, both check-then-act races on the gate
# directory itself that no amount of additional shell-level verification can
# close (POSIX shell has no "unlink only if this is still the same object"):
#   1. The self-heal's `rm -rf` can remove a gate it never judged abandoned --
#      by the time it runs, that path may be a FRESH gate another racer just
#      won. Observed as two RECLAIM winners in one round.
#   2. The FRESH (non-reclaim) acquire path took NO gate at all, so it was
#      never serialized against a gate winner's `rm -f "$LOCK"` + `write_lock`
#      -- a top-level `write_lock` landing in that two-step gap could succeed
#      alongside a reclaim. Observed as one reclaim + one FRESH winner.
# MEASURED live against the mkdir-gate script: 2 of 150 rounds at 32-way
# contention under 28-way CPU saturation, starting from an already-abandoned
# gate, with NO stall injected -- i.e. reachable under ordinary crash-recovery
# contention, not only a machine already stalled. That is the evidence lode-y3dw
# weighed against a gate-ownership check narrowing the window further (the
# alternative the ticket also considered, and which cannot close either route
# above -- both are races on the gate OBJECT, not on which token currently
# claims to own it).
#
# THE FIX: `flock(1)` wraps the ENTIRE acquire decision -- fresh-lock attempt,
# staleness check, and reclaim -- in one exclusive lock held on a dedicated
# file (`$LOCK.flock`, never the lock-record file itself) for the lifetime of
# the flock'd file descriptor. This is a genuine capability upgrade over the
# mkdir gate, not a narrower version of the same idea: a kernel `flock` is
# released the instant the holding PROCESS exits, by ANY means (normal exit,
# crash, `kill -9`) -- there is no "abandoned but not yet aged out" state for
# a competitor to race against, because there is no separate object (a gate
# directory) whose lifecycle can be judged wrong. A second acquire attempted
# while the first is inside this section BLOCKS (bounded by
# `LAND_LOCK_FLOCK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, small -- the section it guards is a
# handful of forks, not a /land pass) rather than being handed a chance to
# race; on timeout it skips the tick exactly like "lock still held", which is
# the same safe direction every other undecided read in this script takes.
# A stalled-but-alive holder cannot be displaced (it still holds the flock);
# a crashed holder releases it immediately (no permanent-wedge risk, and no
# second staleness window of its own to size). This also makes the SECOND
# reachable route above -- the FRESH path racing a reclaim -- structurally
# impossible, not merely improbable, since both paths now execute inside the
# same mutex rather than only the reclaim half of it.
#
# PORTABILITY TRADEOFF, spelled out rather than hidden: `flock(1)` ships in
# util-linux, present on essentially every Linux distribution but ABSENT on
# macOS and stock git-bash, both of which CLAUDE.md's "New machine setup"
# contemplates. `acquire` checks for it explicitly (`command -v flock`) and,
# if missing, reports a MACHINE FAULT and skips the tick -- landing stays
# blocked rather than silently reverting to the two-winner-capable behaviour
# this ticket closed. `/land` is documented to run on ONE machine, so this is
# a one-time environment gap per machine, not a per-tick cost; a human
# choosing to run `/land` on a flock-less machine is expected to install
# util-linux (Homebrew ships a `flock` formula on macOS) rather than the
# script silently downgrading its own guarantee. `heartbeat` and `release`
# need no such check -- neither one contends against a concurrent acquire the
# way the reclaim decision does.
#
# `acquire`'s own O_EXCL create (the FRESH-lock path) was always atomic on its
# own and remains so, unchanged (`write_lock`'s `noclobber`) -- it is now ALSO
# inside the flock'd section, which is what closes route 2 above.
#
# NOTE: this remains a DIFFERENT object and a DIFFERENT concern from
# lode-q9pm. q9pm is about `heartbeat` refusing to re-stamp the MAIN LOCK's
# own record once this pass no longer owns it (the self-concealing gap
# described further below) -- unaffected by how `acquire`'s OWN internal race
# is closed. lode-y3dw's conclusion does retire the "shares machinery with
# lode-q9pm" framing the gate-ownership-check alternative would have created:
# there is no reclaim gate any more for a shared token-comparison helper to
# live next to, so q9pm's owner-token check is scoped entirely to `$LOCK`
# itself and `heartbeat`, with nothing here for it to coordinate with.
#
# OWNERSHIP CHECK (lode-q9pm, made a REQUIRED argument by lode-yuwt).
# `heartbeat` and `release` require the calling pass's own remembered token as
# their final argument (documented in `heartbeat`'s Usage entry below) and
# refuse to touch the lock record on a mismatch, rather than silently
# concealing an overlap with a displaced holder (`heartbeat` exits 1 without
# re-stamping; `release` exits 0 without removing $LOCK). `heartbeat`
# PRESERVES the record's existing owner token (lode-ao95) rather than
# regenerating it, so the field stays meaningful to compare call to call --
# see the MERGE RESOLUTION note below for why that specific behaviour was the
# merge outcome, not a redesign.
#
# lode-yuwt (2026-08-07): the argument is REQUIRED, not optional. lode-q9pm
# originally shipped it as an OPTIONAL final argument, purely for backward
# compatibility with a caller that had not yet been updated to thread its own
# token through. That compatibility need never actually existed -- there is
# no external caller of this script; every caller lives in this repo, and
# every real call site was updated to supply its token in the same change
# that added the check. Leaving the argument optional meant the safety
# property was opt-in per call site rather than an invariant of the script
# itself, and a future call site that simply forgot the argument would
# silently degrade to the pre-lode-q9pm blind behaviour with nothing to catch
# it. Requiring it turns "forgot to thread the token" into a loud, immediate
# usage error (exit 2) instead.
#
# TWO call sites are sanctioned to pass the explicit `--land-lock-blind`
# sentinel instead of a real token -- explicitly, so the opt-out is visible at
# the call site rather than looking like an oversight, and greppable as
# `land-lock-blind-ok:`:
#   - `.claude/skills/land/SKILL.md` Section 0's parse-failure bail path,
#     which must release the lock it just acquired before it has had any
#     chance to persist its own token to disk;
#   - `scripts/land-merge-one.sh`, whose own third positional argument stays
#     OPTIONAL (a direct invocation must still run) and which substitutes the
#     sentinel when it is empty, after warning.
# Each carries its own comment; both are pinned by tests/test_land_lock.py.
#
# lode-yuwt ALSO considered, and explicitly REJECTED, making the check a
# self-reading invariant of this script (`acquire` writes a token file that
# `heartbeat`/`release` read back themselves, collapsing every call-site
# argument to zero): there is no self-reading form that keeps `release`'s
# "a caller that never held the lock can call it harmlessly" contract, so
# per-call-site threading is the correct end state, not a stopgap. Full
# reasoning lives in docs/decisions.md (search "lode-yuwt") and
# docs/agents-workflow.md -- deliberately not re-expanded here (lode-1n4x).
#
# For WHY this check exists (the self-concealing-overlap hazard: a displaced
# pass that keeps blindly re-stamping a reclaimed lock makes a genuine
# overlap look like one continuous holder) and HOW the token threads across
# `.claude/skills/land/SKILL.md`'s separate Bash invocations to reach
# `heartbeat`/`release` here at all, see docs/agents-workflow.md's canonical
# paragraph (search that file for "Threading mechanism.").
#
# MERGE RESOLUTION (lode-ao95 x lode-m87j). This branch was built against a
# trunk with no `heartbeat`; lode-m87j landed on trunk afterward, and this
# file conflicted with it on merge. The conflict was SEMANTIC, not just
# textual -- taking either side wholesale would have been wrong in a way no
# test caught at the time:
#   * trunk's `heartbeat` called `lock_record` with NO argument. This
#     branch's `lock_record` reads the owner token from `$1`. Under
#     `set -u` that call fails outright, so taking this branch's side
#     wholesale would have broken heartbeat -- loudly, against trunk's
#     heartbeat tests. That loudness was deliberate: the mandatory
#     positional is a merge tripwire, and it was NOT "fixed" with a default.
#   * Taking trunk's 4-field `lock_record` wholesale would have silently
#     dropped the owner token and reverted the reclaim to the non-atomic
#     `rm`-then-create form.
#   * The resolution kept that branch's reclaim gate AND trunk's
#     `heartbeat` (the gate is gone again as of lode-y3dw -- only the
#     `heartbeat` half of this resolution still constrains the code below),
#     and made `heartbeat` PRESERVE the existing token (via
#     `token_of`, see below) rather than regenerate or blank it -- a
#     heartbeat that minted a fresh token every tick would have destroyed
#     the one thing lode-q9pm needs to compare against, turning the field
#     into decoration while looking correct.
#   `tests/test_land_lock.py::test_heartbeat_preserves_the_existing_owner_token`
#   pins this.
#
# Usage: scripts/land-lock.sh acquire
#        scripts/land-lock.sh heartbeat <own-token>|--land-lock-blind
#        scripts/land-lock.sh release <own-token>|--land-lock-blind
#
# acquire: exit 0 -> lock acquired (fresh, or reclaimed from a stale prior
#                     holder). Caller proceeds with its /land pass. Prints
#                     "land-lock: acquired (token <token>)" (or "... via
#                     reclaim ...") to stdout -- the token is THIS pass's own,
#                     to be captured and re-supplied to `heartbeat`/`release`
#                     as their `<own-token>` argument (lode-q9pm; see below).
#          exit 1 -> another /land is still (plausibly) running on this
#                     machine, or the lock file could not be created at all --
#                     including when the lock PATH itself could not even be
#                     determined, e.g. run from outside any git repository
#                     (lode-8qkb; see the $LOCK derivation below). Caller must
#                     skip this tick cleanly (exit 0 of its OWN, per the
#                     "single lander" convention) -- do not queue, do not run
#                     in parallel. Diagnostic on STDERR.
#
#                     PERSISTENT MACHINE FAULT ESCALATION (lode-oup2): every
#                     MACHINE FAULT branch below (`flock` missing, the lock
#                     path itself undeterminable, the lock file/flock-mutex
#                     unwritable) bumps a persisted consecutive-fault counter
#                     -- never a transient "another /land is still running"
#                     skip, which is proof the machine itself is fine and
#                     resets the counter same as a clean acquire. Once that
#                     counter reaches `LAND_LOCK_FAULT_ESCALATE_THRESHOLD`
#                     (default 3), the MACHINE FAULT stderr line is followed
#                     by a second, distinctly-prefixed line -- "land-lock:
#                     ESCALATE -- ..." -- for a caller to grep for and act on
#                     (SKILL.md Section 0 does; see there). No new exit code:
#                     the exit-code contract stays exactly the three values
#                     documented here (lode-119w already declined to teach a
#                     third code to every collapsing caller for no
#                     behavioural gain; this file follows the same call).
#                     land-lock.sh itself makes NO bd call and creates no
#                     ticket -- it stays dependency-free the same way the rest
#                     of this script already is; escalating to a human is
#                     entirely the caller's business.
#          exit 2 -> usage error (a caller bug, never a lock verdict). NOT
#                     where a rev-parse/machine failure lands -- see below.
# heartbeat <own-token>: re-stamps the lock this pass already holds, so the
#            staleness check measures idle time from the LAST heartbeat
#            rather than the original `acquire` (CAVEAT 1). Call it
#            periodically from inside a still-running pass -- never as a
#            substitute for `acquire`.
#
#            `<own-token>` (also required by `release` below) is REQUIRED
#            (lode-q9pm, made mandatory by lode-yuwt) -- see the OWNERSHIP
#            CHECK section above for the full reasoning. There is no external
#            caller of this script to stay backward compatible with, so an
#            absent or empty argument is now a CALLER BUG, not a supported
#            degraded mode: it is rejected with exit 2 before any lock file
#            is even touched (see the arg-parsing block below). This entry is
#            where that semantics is stated for this file; `release`'s own
#            `<own-token>`, the OWNERSHIP CHECK section, and the `OWN_TOKEN=`
#            assignment below point back here rather than repeating it.
#
#            The ONLY sanctioned way to skip the ownership comparison on
#            purpose is the literal sentinel `--land-lock-blind` in place of
#            a real token, from one of the two call sites named in the
#            OWNERSHIP CHECK section above. Using the sentinel from anywhere
#            else defeats the point of this check and is not sanctioned.
#            exit 0 -> re-stamped (or created fresh, if the file was somehow
#                       already gone -- see the subcommand's own comment).
#            exit 1 -> could not write the lock file -- including when the
#                       lock path itself could not be determined (lode-8qkb),
#                       OR (lode-q9pm) `<own-token>` does not match the
#                       record's current owner token: this pass no longer
#                       holds the lock (another /land reclaimed it) and
#                       heartbeat REFUSES to overwrite the new holder's
#                       record. NOT fatal to the caller's own step by itself
#                       either way (this is bookkeeping, not the work) -- log
#                       and continue; on the mismatch case specifically, the
#                       caller should also stop treating itself as the lock

# the main checkout, one (mis)dispatched into a worktree -- would then take two
# DIFFERENT lockfiles and neither would see the other, silently defeating the
# single-lander guarantee this whole script exists to provide (lode-xkpd,
# discovered while reviewing lode-pcee's identical class of bug one script
# over). `--git-common-dir` returns the ONE shared .git from every worktree of
# the repo, including the main checkout.
#
# `--path-format=absolute` is load-bearing too, for a SECOND, non-worktree
# reason: bare `--git-common-dir` is CWD-RELATIVE inside the main checkout --
# `.git` from the root, but `../../.git` from a subdirectory. Those resolve to
# the same file (so mutual exclusion holds either way), but the path STRING
# differs by cwd, which is not the "byte-identical from every worktree" this
# ticket asked for, and it leaves the `$LOCK` path printed in the diagnostics
# below dependent on the reader's cwd -- directly against
# the operator-inspects-the-right-file reasoning at the bottom of this script.
# Forcing absolute makes the path identical from every cwd AND every worktree.
# Same flag pair, for the same reason, as scripts/assert-main-checkout.sh
# (lode-pcee), which reads the shared .git for its own identity check -- and,
# as of lode-8qkb, the same failure discipline too: the `rev-parse` below is
# wrapped rather than left to `set -e`, so a git failure (most likely: cwd is
# outside any git repository at all) cannot escape as git's bare, undocumented
# 128. Unlike assert-main-checkout.sh, that maps onto exit 1, NOT exit 2 --
# the header above reserves exit 2 for a caller/usage bug, so this is folded
# into the same MACHINE FAULT class as the "cannot create $LOCK" branch below.
# Mutual exclusion was never at risk (SKILL.md's caller collapses any non-zero
# to "skip the tick"); what this closes is observability -- the diagnostic now
# names the cause, and which subcommand hit it, instead of a bare `fatal:`.
#
# STILL LATENT rather than live -- but NOT because assert-main-checkout.sh
# covers it. That guard runs in land/SKILL.md **Section 1**, and this lock is
# acquired in **Section 0**, before it: nothing asserts where the pass is
# running until after the lockfile has already been written, so a misdispatched
# pass would write a worktree-private lock and only then be stopped. What
# actually keeps this latent is the operating convention that /land runs in the
