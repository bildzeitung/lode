# Retry wrapper for `bd dolt push`, hardening it against the two concurrent-writer
# failure modes documented in docs/decisions.md ("bd dolt push retry-on-reject",
# lode-83d) and validated in docs/agents-workflow.md ("Concurrent bd dolt push under
# fan-out", lode-nps.3):
#
#   1. Rejected push (non-fast-forward). `dolt push` to refs/dolt/data is
#      fast-forward-only + atomically CAS-protected on the branch ref, exactly like
#      `git push` — a losing concurrent writer is REJECTED, never silently dropped,
#      and the fix is mechanical: pull (merge the winner's commit in), then retry.
#   2. Embedded-mode lock contention. lode runs bd in embedded (in-process Dolt
#      engine) mode, and every worktree on a machine shares ONE physical Dolt store
#      (single-writer, enforced via file lock per beads' own docs). A concurrent
#      writer mid-operation produces a transient "database is locked" error that
#      clears as soon as that writer's single operation finishes.
#
# Both failure modes are transient and self-clear within a few seconds under
# lode's actual write pattern (disjoint per-ticket rows, short-lived locks) — a
# short backoff-and-retry loop is the correct-weight fix; switching bd to Dolt
# server mode is deliberately NOT done here (see docs/decisions.md).
#
# Before any of that: scripts/bd-dolt-push-guard.sh (lode-fzau) runs once, up
# front, as a backstop against publishing a suspicious local DB (one that was
# bootstrap-hydrated from a stale, passive jsonl snapshot instead of built up
# via ordinary dolt-native writes/pulls -- a code-reviewer/coding worktree was
# observed with exactly this once, and would have reverted ~159 issues of
# real cross-machine state had the guard existed then). See that script's own
# header for the full mechanism and the two failure modes it is deliberately
# designed NOT to trip on (a fresh clone / `bd init`, and requiring the
# remote to be reachable on every ordinary bd write).
#
# Usage: scripts/bd-dolt-push.sh [any `bd dolt push` flags, e.g. --remote foo]
# Env overrides (mainly for tests): BD_DOLT_PUSH_MAX_ATTEMPTS, BD_DOLT_PUSH_BASE_DELAY
# Guard env overrides: BD_DOLT_PUSH_GUARD_MIN_RATIO_PCT, BD_DOLT_PUSH_GUARD_FORCE
