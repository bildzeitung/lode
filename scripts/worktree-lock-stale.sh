# Is a `git worktree lock` reason STALE (the session that acquired it is
# dead), or must it still be treated as LIVE? (lode-yrtu)
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: /land's Section 4 worktree-GC backstop skips every
# `locked` worktree unconditionally, before any other predicate runs. The
# lock recorded by the Claude Code harness (every `isolation: "worktree"`
# launch worktree, plus `.claude/agents/coding.md`'s own explicit
# pre-first-commit lock) is PER-SESSION, not per-agent -- confirmed by
# measurement (lode-yrtu): several worktrees can share ONE lock-owner pid
# (the session/parent process), so a dead session leaves EVERY worktree it
# ever locked stuck behind the `locked` check forever -- `locked` is tested
# first, ahead of any merged/dirty predicate, so nothing downstream ever
# gets a chance to reclaim them.
#
# WHY NOT PLAIN `kill -0 <pid>` (the usual unsafe idiom): a pid is reused by
# the OS once its original process exits, so `kill -0` alone cannot tell
# "the original session is still running" from "an unrelated later process
# happens to have been assigned the same pid." /land's OWN single-lander
# lock (scripts/land-lock.sh) hit exactly this class of problem and solved
# it with a WALL-CLOCK staleness window instead, because the pid it records
# is a single Bash tool sub-invocation that has, by construction, already
# exited by the time a later invocation reads it -- pid liveness is
# structurally meaningless there (see land-lock.sh's own header).
#
# THIS case is different: the pid recorded in a `git worktree lock` reason
# is the long-lived HARNESS/AGENT SESSION process, not a single Bash
# sub-invocation, so pid liveness IS a meaningful signal here -- it just
# needs the reuse hazard closed. `/proc/<pid>/stat`'s own `starttime` field
# (the 22nd whitespace-separated field, counting `(comm)` as one field) is
# the fix: the harness records a `start <token>` alongside the pid at lock
# time, and that token is the SAME starttime value `/proc/<pid>/stat` itself
# reports for that pid at the moment the lock was taken. A pid that has
# since been reused shows a *different* starttime than the one recorded, so
# comparing the two closes the reuse hole without resorting to a fixed
# wall-clock window (which would either reclaim a genuinely still-running,
# merely-long-lived session, or leave a dead session's worktrees leaked for
# the entire window regardless of how obviously dead they are).
#
# Usage: worktree-lock-stale.sh <lock-reason-text>
#   <lock-reason-text> is the porcelain `locked` line's reason with the
#   leading "locked " stripped, e.g.
#   "claude agent agent-<hash> (pid 1838142 start 76727921)" -- or empty,
#   for a lock taken with no reason at all (e.g. a human's own `git worktree
#   lock` with no message).
#
# Exit 0 -- STALE: the recorded pid is not running at all, or it IS running
#           but /proc's starttime for it no longer matches the recorded
#           token (pid reuse) -- safe to treat this lock as not actually
#           held by a live session.
# Exit 1 -- NOT proven stale: either the lock is genuinely live (pid
#           running, starttime matches), or the reason text couldn't be
#           parsed, or /proc/<pid>/stat couldn't be read. FAILS CLOSED in
#           every one of those ambiguous cases -- a lock this script cannot
#           positively prove dead is treated as live, never reclaimed.
#           Getting this wrong in the other direction risks exactly what
#           lode-oqr already cost once: destroying a live build's worktree.
#           Also returned on a usage error (wrong argument count) -- a
#           caller bug is not evidence of staleness either.
