"""Fence-aware structural chunker for the ``docs/`` lookup index (``lode-t6o1.1``).

Splits each file of ``docs/*.md`` into retrievable **units** -- ``(path, line_lo,
line_hi, first_line, body)`` -- for the on-demand SQLite FTS5 index over the docs
corpus (``docs/decisions.md``, entry ``lode-t6o1``; epic ``lode-t6o1``'s Design
field). This module is *only* the chunker; building/querying the FTS5 index is
``lode-t6o1.2``.

**ONE boundary rule** (the decided shape; the rationale and the refuted two-rule
alternative live in the decision record cited above -- do not re-derive them):
split at the deepest ATX heading level present in the file, or at top-level
``- `` bullets in a file with no headings at all (``docs/decisions.md``). A
post-pass hard-splits any unit still over :data:`MAX_UNIT_BYTES` at the next
rung down -- heading -> bullet -> blank-line-delimited paragraph.

Boundary detection is **fence-aware**: a ``## `` or ``- `` inside a fenced code
block is someone's example, not document structure. See :func:`_fence_flags`.

Units tile each file exactly: line numbers are 1-based, inclusive on both ends,
gapless and non-overlapping, so ``"\\n".join(text.splitlines()[u.line_lo - 1 :
u.line_hi]) == u.body`` and a caller can ``Read`` precisely that range.

Each file is also :func:`classify`-ied as ``"decision-record"`` or
``"reference/process"``, consumed by the ``--class`` filter in the CLI ticket
(``lode-t6o1.3``) -- per the decision record's explicit split, not a guess.

    shown as an example inside a ``` block, or a ```` ```` ```` wrapper around a
