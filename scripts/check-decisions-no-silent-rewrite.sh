# Silent-in-place-rewrite guard for docs/decisions.md (lode-rl6s).
#
# tests/test_decisions_supersession_markers.py guards the two marker-SHAPE
# defects lode-ur6o found (an off-pattern lead-in, a line-wrapped id). Both
# scans key on an artifact a *marker* leaves behind. A silent in-place
# rewrite of an EXISTING entry -- editing or deleting previously-committed
# text instead of appending, the exact thing docs/decisions.md's own preamble
# forbids -- leaves nothing for a marker-shaped scan to key on (lode-nlk6's
# documented limitation; confirmed to actually bite once by lode-hg49, whose
# reviewer had to hand-restore a rewritten entry).
#
# This script closes that gap with git's own diff: between two points in
# history, did any PRE-EXISTING, non-blank line of docs/decisions.md
# disappear?
#
# SCOPE is base...head, not full repository history: a full-history replay
# was tried and rejected as permanently noisy (paragraph rewrapping alone
# flags dozens of legitimate commits). Full reasoning in docs/decisions.md,
# search "lode-rl6s".
#
# Usage: scripts/check-decisions-no-silent-rewrite.sh <base-ref> [<head-ref>]
#   <head-ref> defaults to HEAD. Pass an ordinary ref (e.g. origin/trunk) --
#   the merge base is resolved here, by the THREE-dot comparison below, and a
#   caller must never hand-compute one.
#
# Exit 0 -> no pre-existing non-blank line of docs/decisions.md was removed
#           between the merge base of the two refs and <head-ref>. Silent.
# Exit 1 -> at least one was. Prints each offending removed line, prefixed
#           with "REMOVED: ", to stdout.
# Exit 2 -> USAGE/MACHINE fault. Per lode-9i2p, via gate-lib.sh's shared
#           gate_could_not_run: a machine fault, NEVER a verdict on the
#           content -- a caller must not read it as "no rewrite found".

set -uo pipefail   # deliberately NOT -e: exit 1 is a live content verdict
                   # here, and -e would let an inspected command's own
                   # nonzero status short-circuit the script into it

# section for the measurement and why the guard can't use the library it loads.
