# Detect stacked land branches -- which `land/<id>` was built on top of which
# other still-unlanded `land/<base>` -- and print the relation. (lode-s9xe.2)
#
# WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT A FENCED SNIPPET. This logic previously lived as
# bash inside .claude/skills/land/SKILL.md, and it did not parse: the outer
# "for every ordered pair" loop existed only as a COMMENT, and a bare
# `continue` sat outside any loop. The agent therefore re-derived an O(n^2)
# driver freehand on every pass, for an algorithm whose subtleties that file
# spends forty lines warning about -- with no test possible, because there was
# no code to test. The failure mode is silent: an undetected stack lets /land
# merge a dependent BEFORE its base, dragging the base's unreviewed content
# onto trunk under the dependent's ticket name.
#
# DETECTION -- shared history off trunk, NOT tip-ancestry.
# Two branches cut independently share nothing but trunk. So the relation to
# test is: does any of their merge-bases lie OFF trunk? If one does, the pair
# shares non-trunk history, and that shared commit is a base's tip at the
# moment a dependent merged it.
#
#   * Enumerate ALL merge-bases (`--all`), never the single-result form. A base
#     that takes a needs-rebase pickup AFTER a dependent merged it acquires a
#     SECOND merge-base -- the dependent's own cut point, which IS an ancestor
#     of trunk. Single-result `git merge-base` returns one of the two
#     ARBITRARILY; when it returns the on-trunk one, the pair reads as
#     unrelated and the stack goes undetected.
#   * Do NOT reduce this to `git merge-base --is-ancestor <X> <Y>` ("is X's tip
#     contained in Y"). A base's tip MOVES after a dependent merges it -- its
#     reviewer pushes fixes, a pickup merges trunk in -- so the tip stops
#     being an ancestor and the whole stack goes invisible. That is the NORMAL
#     flow, not a corner case: a producer stacks on a base precisely while
#     that base is still unlanded and therefore still moving.
#
# DIRECTION -- shared history is necessary, not sufficient. An off-trunk
# merge-base means one of two things:
#   * A STACK: one of the pair merged the other. The shared commit is on the
#     base's first-parent spine but not the dependent's (which reached it
#     through a merge, i.e. a second parent). An edge is emitted.
#   * SIBLINGS: two dependents that each merged the same third base share that
#     base's commits too. There the shared commit is off BOTH spines, neither
#     ordering matches, and NO edge is emitted -- which is the correct answer.
#     Each sibling is still detected against the base by its own pair.
#
# KNOWN GAPS, documented rather than papered over:
#   1. Force-push. The test survives an append but not a rewrite. Nothing in
#      this harness force-pushes a land branch; if one ever is, that pass's
#      graph is not trustworthy.
#   2. Branched-from-base rather than merged-base. If a producer branches
#      directly off `land/<base>` instead of branching from trunk and merging
#      the base in, the shared commit lands on BOTH first-parent spines, so no
#      direction is emitted -- the pair is detected as related but unordered.
#      Indistinguishable from a sibling pair by signature, which is why it is
#      reported (see --report-unordered) rather than guessed at.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/stacked-graph.sh [--base-ref <ref>] [--report-unordered]
#
#   --base-ref            trunk ref to measure against (default: origin/trunk)
#   --report-unordered    also emit UNORDERED lines for related-but-undirected pairs
#
# Output (stdout), one record per line, tab-separated:
#   EDGE       <dependent>  <base>     direct
#   EDGE       <dependent>  <base>     transitive
#   UNORDERED  <a>          <b>                   (only with --report-unordered)
#
#   UNORDERED means "related, and NO direction exists in either ordering" -- a
#   pair that also carries an EDGE is never reported unordered.
#
#   "direct" = <base> is <dependent>'s NEAREST base: no other base of
#   <dependent> itself has <base> as one of ITS bases. /land needs this to pick
#   the single base land-review diffs against -- handing it a transitive base
#   would make the diff carry the intermediate branch's work as if it were this
#   branch's. The full relation (direct + transitive) is what the bounce and
#   escalation paths need to ask "does deleting X strand a live descendant?".
#
# Exit codes: 0 = ran (zero or more records), 2 = machine fault. There is no
# exit 1: this is a query, not a verdict, so "no stacks" is a successful run.
