# (.claude/skills/release/SKILL.md#2-derive-the-proposal).
#
# Extracted per lode-ns3r: the inline snippet this replaces read each commit's
# full message via `git log RANGE --format='%B%x00'` +
# `while IFS= read -r -d '' MSG`, then took the commit's subject as
# `SUBJECT=$(printf '%s' "$MSG" | head -1)`. git inserts a newline AFTER each
# record's `%B` expansion, BEFORE the `%x00` delimiter -- so the NUL-delimited
# stream is actually "body1\n\x00body2\n\x00...", not
# "body1\x00body2\x00...". Every record from the SECOND onward is therefore
# captured WITH A LEADING NEWLINE, so `head -1` on it returns an EMPTY first
# line, and the subject regexes (^feat/^fix/^...!:) never match anything but
# the newest commit in the range. Concrete case (lode-905v): v1.1.0..trunk
# during the v1.2.0 release contained 2 feat(...) commits, neither of them the
# newest commit in the range -- the inline snippet computed BUMP=none (would
# have proposed v1.1.1 instead of the correct v1.2.0). Only a manual re-scan
# by the operator caught it before the release shipped.
#
# Fixed per the ticket's "simplest" fix option: subjects are read from a
# SEPARATE `git log RANGE --format='%s'` stream, one full line per commit --
# a commit subject is, by git's own convention, always exactly one line, so
# there is no record-splitting to get wrong and no NUL/newline-ordering
# footgun left to trip over. The BREAKING-CHANGE-in-body check still needs
# the full message body (the marker can appear anywhere in a footer, not just
# the subject), so it scans a separate `--format='%B'` stream for the literal
# marker -- but that scan only ever needs to know "did ANY commit in range
# contain this marker", never WHICH commit, so it is immune to the same
# per-record-boundary bug by construction (no per-commit split is needed at
# all for a whole-stream substring search).
#
# Usage: scripts/release-bump.sh <range>       # e.g. "v1.1.0..HEAD"
#
# Exit 0 -> prints exactly one of: breaking | feat | fix | none
# Exit 2 -> MACHINE FAULT (range doesn't resolve, git failure). Diagnostic to
#           stderr, nothing to stdout -- same "exit 2 is the machine, never
#           the content" convention as scripts/merge-precheck.sh (lode-9i2p).
#
# Precedence when several kinds of commits are present: breaking > feat > fix
# > none -- matches docs/release.md and the skill's own written precedence.
#
# Read-only: runs `git log`, never touches the working tree, never writes bd.

# Each `git log` read is CAPTURED into a variable with its exit status
# checked, and every match then runs against that variable via a here-string.
# `git log` is NEVER piped straight into `grep`. Two distinct bugs made that
# mandatory, both of which shipped in the first cut of this script:
#
#   1. SIGPIPE + pipefail = a silent FALSE NEGATIVE. `grep -q` exits the
#      instant it matches, closing the pipe; `git log` is then killed by
#      SIGPIPE (exit 141), and `set -o pipefail` promotes that 141 to the
#      status of the WHOLE pipeline -- so `if git log ... | grep -q ...`
#      evaluated FALSE exactly when the marker WAS found, provided it was
#      found early enough that output was still in flight. That inverts the
#      check precisely in the case that matters most: a recent commit
#      carrying the marker. Measured on lode's own history, `v1.1.0..HEAD` is
#      ~75KB of `%B` -- far past the threshold -- and a synthetic range with
#      the marker in the NEWEST commit returned `feat` (MINOR) where the
#      right answer was `breaking` (MAJOR). Note this was a POSITION-dependent
#      false negative: the same class of bug this script was extracted to fix
#      (lode-ns3r), reintroduced through a different mechanism. A here-string
#      has no writer process, so there is no pipe left to break.
#
#   2. An unchecked `git log` failure produced NO output, which reads
#      identically to "no marker" / "no recognized prefixes" and returned a
#      legitimate-looking `none` on exit 0 -- a machine fault reported as
#      content, the exact thing this script's exit-2 contract exists to
#      prevent.
#
# Checking each read's status also removes the need for a separate up-front
# range validation: an unresolvable range fails the first `git log` with
# git's own diagnostic, so one error path covers both.

# NOTE on the `|| exit $?` at each call site below, which is load-bearing:
# `read_log` is always invoked inside a command substitution, and a command
# substitution runs in a SUBSHELL -- so `gate_could_not_run`'s `exit 2` ends
# only that subshell, NOT this script. Without the explicit propagation the
# assignment would simply succeed with an empty value and the script would
# print a confident `none` on exit 0, which is precisely the machine-fault-
# reported-as-content failure the exit-2 contract exists to prevent. The
# diagnostics themselves still reach the terminal either way (stderr is not
# captured by the substitution); it is only the exit status that needs help.
