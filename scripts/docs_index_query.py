"""Typer CLI over the docs/ lookup index -- ranked pointers, never answers
(``lode-t6o1.3``).

Builds the index (``scripts/docs_index_build.py``, ``lode-t6o1.2``) fresh on
every invocation and returns RANKED POINTERS + SNIPPETS: ``path:line_lo-line_hi``,
the unit's first line, and a short snippet. It NEVER prints a whole unit and
NEVER synthesizes a prose answer -- this is a lookup tool, not a second Q&A
system (``docs/decisions.md``, entry ``lode-t6o1``). The caller reads the
exact range itself.

FTS5 INPUT ESCAPING is the load-bearing half of this ticket. Raw user input
must never reach ``MATCH`` unescaped -- measured against a real index during
the epic's ``/challenge``: a bd issue id (``lode-nt98``) fails with ``no such
column: nt98`` (the hyphen parses as a column filter), a slash-prefixed
question (``what did we decide about /land?``) is an FTS5 syntax error, and a
hyphenated term (``push-vs-pull``) fails the same way. Every bd issue id --
the most natural query key in this repo -- would error on query one.
:func:`_escape_query` fixes all three: split on whitespace, wrap EACH
resulting token in double quotes (escaping any embedded ``"`` by doubling
it, FTS5's own quoting rule), and join with a space -- FTS5's implicit AND
between phrase terms. A double-quoted phrase is matched as a literal string
by the FTS5 query grammar, so no character inside it (hyphen, slash, digit)
is ever parsed as query syntax.
