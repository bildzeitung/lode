# mmdc parses each ```mermaid block against the same mermaid.js parser GitHub
# renders with, so syntax errors are caught before they ship. Runs in Docker so

# Usage: scripts/validate-mermaid.sh

# AUDIT (lode-6znq, 2026-07-29, decided by measurement -- supersedes lode-bss5
# Finding D and lode-3xqb, both of which kept `-e` and guarded sites one
# at a time). Shebang form: `#!/bin/bash`, matching gate-lib.sh's own form --
# NOT `#!/usr/bin/env bash`, which the other gate-lib.sh consumers use and
# which the consistency argument for dropping `-e` cites, but which turned out
# NOT to be free here: `env bash` does its own PATH lookup for the `bash` binary,
# and tests/test_validate_mermaid_gate.py's pre-flight fixtures (`fake_bin`)
# deliberately run this script with a PATH containing only a `dirname` shim --
# they assume the interpreter itself is reached by the shebang's own absolute
# path, never searched for. Measured while building this ticket, and again
# independently in review: switching to `env bash` breaks EVERY test that runs
# this gate on a hermetic PATH (`_run_gate(fake_bin)` with no `inherit_path`)
# with exit 127 ("env: 'bash': No such file or directory") -- not a content or
# machine-fault exit at all. Stated as a predicate, not a count, so it stays
# true as fixtures are added. `#!/bin/bash` does no PATH search for the
# interpreter and keeps them green unmodified, so it is the deliberate pick
# here: it is the form that does not require touching a pinned test fixture.
#
# WHY DROP -e: `-e` was kept here (lode-bss5) on the theory that this script's
# machine-fault-vs-content split lives entirely in `if`/`else` arms, which bash
# exempts from `-e` by its own rules, so `-e` couldn't short-circuit the split.
# True, but incomplete: `-e` still governed every command NOT inside an `if`,
# and most commands fail with status 1 -- which in THIS script means "invalid
# mermaid". Two review passes (lode-bss5 -> lode-3xqb) each found sites the
# previous pass's audit missed (mktemp, then REPO=/printf/chmod x2, then the
# EXIT trap's `rm -rf` and `basename`), instance-fixing the same defect class
# open one route at a time. The pattern itself is the argument for removing
# the class instead: any command added below without a guard is a new,
# silent route onto exit 1, and no audit can prove there are no more of them
# for a class it's still possible to add to by omission.
# Measured (bash 5.2, shebang honoured): `mktemp -d` failing under -e exited
# 1, and so did the REPO= assignment, the printf into $CFG/puppeteer.json, and
# both chmod calls -- the exact lode-9i2p inversion, a machine fault blamed on
# a doc. All five keep their own `gate_could_not_run` guards below (lode-bss5,
# lode-3xqb, lode-dyq0).
#
# THE ONE FAILURE NO PER-SITE GUARD COULD CLOSE (bash 5.2, shebang honoured),
# and why the trap keeps `|| :` anyway: a clean run whose EXIT trap's
# `rm -rf "$CFG"` then fails (its parent went read-only, say) exits with THAT
# command's status under `-e` -- 1, this script's CONTENT verdict -- rewriting
# the status of EVERY exit already decided below it, a guard's correct 2
# included. No `||` guard on a body command can reach this: the trap fires
# after the body is done. This is the single strongest argument FOR dropping `-e` (no per-site
# guard closes it), and it is why the trap itself carries `|| :` below --
# without `-e` that failure can no longer rewrite anything, but the `|| :`
# stays so a broken cleanup is never mistaken for a verdict either way.
#
# THE ONE PLACE THE DECISION EXPECTED DROPPING -e NOT TO BE FREE -- and the
# re-measurement that overturned that expectation (2026-07-29):
# `REPO="$(cd ... && pwd)"` below. With `-e`: a failing `cd` aborts -> exit 1 ->
# fabricated "invalid mermaid" (the known-bad route). WITHOUT `-e` and
# WITHOUT a guard, the decision reasoned: the assignment would continue with
# REPO="", the `for f in "$REPO"/docs/*.md` glob would match nothing, `found`
# would stay 0, and the script would print "no mermaid diagrams found" and
# exit 0 -- a gate reporting GREEN because it validated NOTHING, worse than a
# false red. RE-VERIFIED during this build by temporary sabotage (guard
# removed, REPO forced empty, not left in the code): the false green does NOT
# reproduce against current trunk. `lode-yoc3` (landed 2026-08-03, after the
# decision above was written) added its own escalation inside the per-doc
# loop -- grep scanning the unmatched glob `"$REPO"/docs/*.md` (nullglob is
# deliberately unset, so it passes through as the literal string `docs/*.md`)
# fails with "No such file or directory" (grep exit 2, not 1), and that is now
# caught as a machine fault by the very guard lode-yoc3 added for a different
# reason -- observed: "GATE COULD NOT RUN: grep failed scanning docs/*.md ...
# (exit 2)", exit 2, not the fabricated "nothing to validate" exit 0 the
# original reasoning predicted. So the false-green route this REPO= guard was
# written to close is independently closed today by lode-yoc3's grep guard,
# discovered later and for an unrelated reason. The REPO= guard stays anyway
# -- it is not redundant, just no longer the ONLY barrier: it fails faster
# (before reaching docker or the loop) and with a message that names the
# actual cause ("could not resolve the repo root") instead of grep's
# generic, one-hop-removed complaint about a literal glob string.
# Separately re-verified with the guard in place and a real `cd` failure
# (broken `dirname` on PATH): exit 2 with the GATE COULD NOT RUN banner and
# this gate's advisory trailer, unchanged by the shebang -- the existing
# test_repo_root_resolution_failure_is_gate_could_not_run in
# tests/test_validate_mermaid_gate.py pins that arm permanently. Since
# lode-dyq0 moved the gate-lib.sh source above this assignment, the REPO=
# guard is an ordinary `gate_could_not_run` call like the others below it --
# NOT a pre-library hardcoded fallback. The only hardcoded pre-library
# fallback left in this file is the guard on the gate-lib.sh source itself
# (see the comment there), which genuinely cannot call the helper it is
# checking for.
#
# REJECTED ALTERNATIVE, stated so a future auditor does not re-derive it:
# renumber the CONTENT verdict from exit 1 to exit 3, freeing exit 1 so any
# future unguarded command is safe by construction in both directions.
# Rejected because noxfile.py's `GATE_MACHINE_FAULT = 2` and its
# `lock_currency` session, plus .claude/agents/coding.md, code-reviewer.md and
# .claude/skills/land/SKILL.md, all key on the repo-wide 1=content / 2=machine
# contract -- desyncing this one script from it is worse than the class of bug
# it would close.
#
# THE FULL SITE INVENTORY, every command `-e` used to be able to abort on:
#
#   GUARDED (guard is independent of `-e`; kept regardless of the shebang):
#     - `mktemp -d`            -> gate_could_not_run
#     - `REPO=` (`cd`/`pwd`)   -> gate_could_not_run -- kept for a faster,
#                                 clearer exit, though lode-yoc3's grep guard
#                                 independently closes the same false-green
#                                 route today
#     - `printf` into puppeteer.json -> gate_could_not_run (disk full / $CFG
#                                 gone read-only after mktemp created it)
#     - `chmod 755 "$CFG"`     -> gate_could_not_run
#     - `chmod 644 "$CFG/puppeteer.json"` -> gate_could_not_run
#     - EXIT trap `rm -rf "$CFG"` -> `|| :` (cleanup failure is not a verdict;
#                                 also what makes dropping `-e` safe here, since
#                                 nothing upstream can be rewritten by it now)
#
#   DELETED, NOT GUARDED (parameter expansion cannot fail, so the site stops
#   existing rather than needing a guard):
#     - `basename "$f"` -> `${f##*/}` in the per-doc loop
#
#   SHOWN SAFE TO CONTINUE PAST -- deliberately unguarded:
#     - `set -uo pipefail` itself, and the literal/parameter-expansion
#       assignments `IMAGE="minlag/mermaid-cli:10.9.1"` / `fail=0` /
#       `found=0` / `rel="docs/${f##*/}"` / `found=1` / `fail=1` / `rc=$?` --
#       none of these can fail: a literal assignment to a plain variable
#       can't, and parameter expansion (`${f##*/}`) can't either.
#     - the `trap '...' EXIT` REGISTRATION statement -- registering a trap on
#       a literal, always-valid signal spec cannot fail; only the trap BODY
#       (guarded above with `|| :`) can.
#     - the TESTED CONDITION of every `if` in this file -- always exempt from
#       `-e` by bash's own rules (that's what makes an `if` an `if`), unlike
#       the *body* of that same `if`, which -e does still govern absent a
#       trailing `exit` (see the echo entries below). Enumerated rather than
#       gestured at, since most of them are COMMANDS, not `[ ... ]` tests, and
#       a reader scanning for unguarded external commands will otherwise trip
#       over them: `. gate-lib.sh` (under `if !`), `docker info` (under
#       `if !`), `command -v docker`, `grep -q`, `docker run`, and the two
#       `[ ... ]` tests on `$found` / `$fail`.
#     - the `gate_could_not_run` and `escalate_unless_content` call sites --
#       neither can hand `-e` a nonzero status. Why is gate-lib.sh's contract
#       to state, not this file's: see those functions' own headers there
#       (that `escalate_unless_content` returns 0 on the content path is a
#       contract guarantee, not an accident of this caller).
#
#   ALL SEVEN `echo` STATEMENTS in this file (enumerated mechanically --
#   `grep -n '^[[:space:]]*echo' scripts/validate-mermaid.sh` -- rather than
#   re-derived from a prior version of this header, which is what let an
#   earlier rewrite miss five of them):
#     - the two-line "GATE COULD NOT RUN ... gate-lib.sh is missing or
#       unreadable" / "next to $0 ..." pair, immediately above the hardcoded
#       pre-library `exit 2` on the gate-lib.sh source guard -- a failing
#       echo here does not change that exit: the `exit 2` is a separate,
#       unconditional statement below both echoes, not their status.
#     - "OK    $rel" / "FAIL  $rel" in the per-doc loop -- a failing echo
#       means stdout is gone (closed or full); the exit status the script
#       reports still carries the real verdict either way.
#     - "no mermaid diagrams found in docs/ -- nothing to validate", in the
#       `if [ "$found" -eq 0 ]` body, immediately followed by an explicit
#       `exit 0` -- safe today because that `exit 0` is a separate statement,
#       not the echo's own status. Noted explicitly rather than folded into
#       "inside an `if`," since the exemption that actually matters here is
#       the trailing `exit`, not the surrounding `if`.
#     - "mermaid validation failed" >&2, in the `if [ "$fail" -ne 0 ]` body,
#       immediately followed by an explicit `exit 1` -- same shape and same
#       reasoning as the "no mermaid diagrams found" case above: safe because
#       of the trailing `exit`, not because of the `if`.
#     - "all mermaid diagrams valid" -- DIFFERENT from every echo above: it is
#       the script's LAST command, at the top level, with no trailing `exit`
#       of its own. Before this ticket, the script's own exit status WAS this
#       echo's status -- so a failing echo on an otherwise fully-green run
#       (stdout gone) would report exit 1, this gate's CONTENT verdict
#       "invalid mermaid," on a run where every diagram validated. That is
#       the lode-9i2p inversion, reachable on the fully-green path. Decision:
#       closed outright with a trailing `exit 0` immediately below it -- it
#       costs nothing and removes the last vanishing case in this file,
#       rather than leaving it as an accepted one.
#
# What was missing, unlike every other gate-script consumer, was any
# top-level `-u`/`pipefail`; added below for parity (lode-bss5). Inert today:
# this script contains no pipeline at all, and references no variable meant
# to expand unset. `-u` firing also exits 1 -- the same route as `-e` used to
# open -- worth remembering if a new variable reference is added here.

# every container run with "The command docker could not be found in this
# WSL 2 distro" — indistinguishable, to a caller, from real per-doc syntax
# failures (lode-9i2p). Guard on the INVARIANT instead: can docker actually
# reach a running engine? `docker info` is the cheapest such probe. Exit 2
# (distinct from exit 1's "invalid mermaid") and print NO per-doc FAIL

#     a genuine mermaid syntax error, through mmdc              -> 1
#     mmdc handed a missing input file                          -> 1

  # `|| continue` here cannot tell the two apart, so an unreadable doc was

  # `docker run` partition below: only ONE exit code is a real content
  # answer, everything else escalates; the grep sits inside an `if` so the
  # `else` arm can capture `$?` for escalate_unless_content (see below).
  #
  # Second, unintended consequence, verified in lode-6znq's review by
  # sabotage: this escalation also closes the false-green route the REPO=
  # guard above was written for. With that guard removed and REPO empty, the
  # glob passes through literally, grep exits 2, and THIS check escalates to
  # exit 2 -- reverting just this check to a bare `|| continue` restores the
  # old "nothing to validate" exit 0. Do not weaken it on the theory that the
  # REPO= guard covers that case; the coverage runs the other way too.
  #
  # That vanished-$REPO/docs route reaches grep ONLY because this script
