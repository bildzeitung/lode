# PreToolUse(Bash) guard body (lode-fpmi): deny a Bash call carrying a 40-hex
# string that LOOKS like a git object id but is not one -- the fingerprint of a
# FABRICATED SHA, i.e. an agent pattern-completing a short prefix it held in
# context rather than deriving the value via `git rev-parse`. The invented tail
# is exactly as fluent as a real one, so this is not self-detectable by
# re-reading what was typed; `git cat-file -e` is the mechanical oracle, since a
# fabricated SHA is essentially never a real object.
#
# Usage: scripts/sha-fabrication-guard.sh '<bash command string>'
#
# Prints nothing (allow) or one PreToolUse hookSpecificOutput JSON object with
# permissionDecision "deny" -- same contract as the lode-ij24/lode-o29m guards.
# ALWAYS exits 0: a PreToolUse hook exiting non-zero is itself a defect.
#
# Extracted from .claude/settings.json so it can be driven by tests
# (tests/test_sha_fabrication_guard.py), following scripts/bd-dolt-push-guard.sh
# and scripts/code-concurrency-cap.sh. Each scope narrowing below, and the one
# deliberately accepted over-match, is documented in docs/agents-workflow.md
# ("Guard against fabricated SHAs (lode-fpmi)") and pinned by the tests.
#
# QUOTE-AWARE SEGMENT SPLIT + QUOTED-HEREDOC PRE-PASS (lode-dia6). This guard
# used to split into segments with a plain, quoting-UNAWARE `tr` over the
# shell control-operator characters -- the same shape scripts/gh-write-guard.sh
# carried before lode-obox and lode-d5je fixed it there: a control character
# sitting inside a quoted
# STRING ARGUMENT (a commit message, a doc quoting a real SHA) or inside a
# QUOTED HEREDOC body could manufacture a fake segment start, and a 40-hex
# token then landing in that fake segment got scanned as if it sat inside a
# real bd/git invocation. Both primitives (`_split_unquoted`,
# `strip_quoted_heredoc_bodies`) now live in scripts/shell-quote-split.sh,
# shared with gh-write-guard.sh -- see that file's header for the full
# rationale and the false-positive shapes each fix closes. Sourced below,
# failing CLOSED if it cannot be resolved.

# Cheap fork-free early-out for the overwhelmingly common case: no 40-hex run
# anywhere in the command, so nothing below can possibly deny. This runs on
# EVERY Bash tool call, so it is placed first, ahead of the git/sed/grep/sort
# work it short-circuits. A bash builtin regex, deliberately kept here in the
# tested script rather than inline in .claude/settings.json -- config is where
# this repo has already shipped silent undetected bugs (lode-mh9g, lode-54mo),
# and tests/test_sha_fabrication_guard.py pins the wrapper as logic-free.
# Strict superset of what the scan below can match: the continuation collapse
# only ever replaces a backslash-newline with a space, so it can break a hex run
# apart but never create one.

# Second cheap, fork-free gate (review, lode-dia6), mirroring the command-position
# pre-filter scripts/gh-write-guard.sh carries for the same reason (lode-vrhu):
# `_split_unquoted` is an O(n^2)-ish char loop, far more expensive than the `tr`
# it replaced, and 40-hex runs are NOT rare in this repo's traffic (a SHA pasted
# from `git rev-parse`, a land commit message quoting one, a `sha256:` lock line).
# Measured here: a 8 KB command carrying a 40-hex run but no bd/git word at all
# went 13ms (tr) -> 489ms (split) with no gate; this returns it to ~5ms.
#
# NOT a narrowing of the deny surface, and that needs its own argument: INVOKE_RE
# below only ever matches `bd`/`git` at a SEGMENT start, optionally behind
# `VAR=x` assignments and a fixed wrapper word, each separated by [[:space:]]+,
# and always followed by whitespace or end-of-segment. A segment start is either
# the string start, a newline, or a shell control character (`;&|(){}\``, or `$(`)
# -- every one of them non-alnum-non-underscore. Unlike gh-write-guard.sh's `P`,
# INVOKE_RE has NO path-prefix alternative, so `/usr/bin/git` cannot match either
# side. So every position INVOKE_RE could match already satisfies this test.
# The two transforms that run between here and the split can only DELETE lines
# (heredoc strip) or replace a backslash-newline with a space (continuation
# collapse) -- neither can create a `bd`/`git` word that is not already here.
# Pinned by tests/test_sha_fabrication_guard.py's superset enumeration.
