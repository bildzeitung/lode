# Decide whether a single bd ticket should be auto-selected by /code's ready-
# frontier filter, per lode-bw5k: /code must refuse to auto-select a child
# ticket whose parent epic has never been debated at least once. `/debate`
# stamps a durable `epic-debated` label on an epic when it debates it
# (.claude/skills/debate/SKILL.md); this script is the mechanical check
# `/code`'s auto-select step (.claude/skills/code/SKILL.md, step 2) runs for
# each candidate that already survived the existing human/epic filter
# (lode-8pqv).
#
# Usage: scripts/epic-debate-gate.sh <ticket-id>
#
# A child links to its epic via a `parent-child` dependency whose target has
# `issue_type: epic` (verified against real bd output: `bd show <child-id>
# --json` embeds the epic as a nested object inside `.dependencies[]`, not via
# the top-level `parent_id`/`epic_id` fields, which are null). `bd ready
# --json` doesn't carry `dependencies` at all, so this script re-fetches the
# candidate via `bd show` to get them.
#
# Prints exactly one line to stdout:
#   BUILD <id>                                    -- no parent epic, or the
#                                                     parent epic carries
#                                                     epic-debated
#   SKIP <id> epic not debated (<epic-id>)         -- parent epic exists and
#                                                     lacks the marker
#
# Read-only: this script only ever calls `bd show`, never a bd write.
