# SCAN LENGTH CAP (lode-rjqm). `_split_unquoted` below is a per-character bash
# loop; `local LC_ALL=C` (lode-dia6 review) fixed its O(n^2) *indexing* under a
# UTF-8 locale, but the loop itself is still O(n) iterations of bash's own
# interpreter overhead per character (~30us/byte measured -- 25 KB -> ~740ms),
# with no further per-character algorithmic fix available short of a language
# change. Cost is UNBOUNDED in the input: a 200 KB command (a file catted into
# a commit message, a giant heredoc) would cost ~6s on a hot path both
# PreToolUse(Bash) guards run on EVERY Bash call. Both guards cap the length of
# the string they hand to `_split_unquoted` and FAIL CLOSED (deny) past the
# cap, rather than let cost grow without bound.
#
# 16 KiB. The cap is a COST ceiling, not a "nothing real ever gets this big"
# claim -- 16 KiB already costs ~500ms, so raising it to clear every observed
# input would defeat the point. Measured against this repo's own traffic
# (review, lode-rjqm -- the pre-review figure here sampled only the ~20 OPEN bd
# issues and read as far more headroom than there is): git commit messages sit
# well under it (largest of the last 300: ~4.9 KB, >3x headroom), but across
# the FULL 761-issue bd DB the largest single notes field is ~36 KB, with four
# more between 14 KB and 19 KB. Those accumulated over many `--append-notes`
# calls, so it is not established that any single command ever exceeded the
# cap -- but a big one-shot `bd update ... --notes` plainly can, and past the
# cap it now DENIES. That is the deliberate trade: a denied command is a cheap,
# recoverable cost (append in smaller pieces, or surface it to a human to widen
# the cap), while silently scanning for seconds on every Bash call is not, and
# silently NOT scanning would be a false ALLOW. Whether 16 KiB is still the
# right number now the premise is corrected is filed as its own follow-up.
# Full argument and the (a)/(b)/(c) options weighed: docs/agents-workflow.md.
SHELL_QUOTE_SPLIT_MAX_LEN=16384
#
# Shared quote-aware shell scanning primitives for the PreToolUse(Bash) guards
# (lode-dia6). SOURCED, never executed directly -- no `set -euo pipefail` here,
# since that would leak into whichever guard sources this file; each caller
# owns its own shell options. Deliberately NOT marked executable (review,
# lode-dia6): in scripts/ the `+x` bit means "entry point", and running this
# file would be a silent no-op. The shebang stays -- shellcheck uses it for
# dialect detection, and this file is bash-only. Both properties are pinned by
# tests/test_shell_quote_split_lib.py.
#
# Extracted from scripts/gh-write-guard.sh (lode-o29m/lode-9mbt), where both
# functions were first written and are still sabotage-verified by
# tests/test_gh_write_guard.py. scripts/sha-fabrication-guard.sh (lode-fpmi)
# used to carry its OWN, quoting-UNAWARE segment split (`tr ';&|(){}\`' '\n'`)
# -- byte-identical in shape to gh-write-guard.sh's pre-lode-obox splitter --
# which meant a 40-hex SHA appearing inside a quoted string argument or a
# quoted heredoc body (a commit message, a doc quoting a real SHA) could
# manufacture a fake segment start and be scanned as if it sat at the start of
# a bd/git invocation. lode-obox fixed quoted ARGUMENTS and lode-d5je fixed
# quoted HEREDOC BODIES, both privately to gh-write-guard.sh -- this ticket
# (lode-dia6) is the sibling guard catching up, via ONE shared library instead
# of a second, hand-ported copy that would only re-open the same drift: the
# two guards already carried a byte-identical defect once, because they
# carried byte-identical code once. Every future refinement to either
# function now reaches both callers by construction.
#
# Both callers MUST fail CLOSED (deny) if this file cannot be resolved or
# sourced -- see the fail-closed check each guard script runs immediately
# before `source`-ing this file. A missing/unreadable copy of this file must
# never silently disable either guard's quoting fix.
#
# strip_quoted_heredoc_bodies (lode-d5je): removes the BODY of any QUOTED
# heredoc (<<'EOF', <<"EOF", <<\EOF) from a command string before it is
# scanned -- a quoted heredoc body is inert text (the shell performs NO
# substitution in it), so a worked example inside one (e.g. a command
# substitution shown as prose, or -- this guard's own concern -- a 40-hex
# string quoted as a real SHA in a commit-message example) must not
# manufacture a fake segment start or a fake token. An UNQUOTED heredoc
# (<<EOF) is the opposite: substitution IS real there, so its body is kept
# (still scanned) untouched. Every deviation from real shell heredoc parsing
# is deliberately biased toward stripping LESS than the shell would, because
# stripping MORE is a false ALLOW (a live write/SHA hidden from the scan) --
# the unrecoverable failure for a default-deny guard. Rules enforcing that
# bias (each pinned by its own test in tests/test_gh_write_guard.py):
#   1. A `<<<` HERESTRING is not a heredoc and consumes no body.
#   2. An UNQUOTED heredoc's body is tracked but never inspected for
#      operators, so a quoted-heredoc lookalike written INSIDE it cannot
#      start a strip.
#   3. A quoted heredoc that is never CLOSED strips nothing -- its held lines
#      are emitted at end of input, rather than swallowing the remainder of
#      the command.

# _split_unquoted (lode-obox): emits $1 with every UNQUOTED occurrence of

# RESIDUAL (fail-OPEN, accepted): an UNBALANCED quote leaves the tail "inside"
# a quote, so nothing after it splits -- the PERMISSIVE direction, not the

# PERFORMANCE (review, lode-dia6). `local LC_ALL=C` is load-bearing, not a
# micro-optimization. Under a UTF-8 locale bash must walk the string to find
# CHARACTER i, so `${s:i:1}` is O(i) and this loop is O(n^2) -- measured 4.0s on
# a 25 KB command. Byte indexing makes it O(n). It is behaviour-preserving: the
# loop only ever compares against ASCII operator characters, and every UTF-8
# non-ASCII byte is >= 0x80, so no byte of a multibyte character can collide
# with one; every other byte is concatenated through unchanged, so the output
# is byte-identical. `local` keeps the C locale out of the callers' grep and
# [[:space:]] semantics -- pinned by a test.
