# Decide whether closing a ticket completes its parent epic, per lode-v4rk:
# /land's Section-4 epic-completion check must flag a parent epic
# `epic-ready-to-audit` once its last open child closes -- that label is the
# ONLY automatic trigger for `/epic-audit`.
#
# The original inline snippet (`.claude/skills/land/SKILL.md`) enumerated an
# epic's children by reading `bd show <epic-id> --json`'s `.dependents[]`
# array, which is only populated with the opt-in `--include-dependents` flag
# -- see scripts/epic-children-closed.sh (this script's own child-completion
# check, and the same fix reused by /epic-audit and /sweep, which each had
# their own copy of the identical bug) for the full mechanism writeup.
#
# Usage: scripts/epic-completion-check.sh <closed-ticket-id>
#
# Prints exactly one line to stdout when the epic should be flagged:
#   READY <epic-id>      -- <epic-id> is an open epic whose last parent-child
#                            child just closed, and it does not already carry
#                            epic-ready-to-audit or epic-audited
# Prints nothing (exit 0) otherwise: no parent, the parent isn't an open
# epic, an open child remains, or the false-positive guard above holds.
#
# Read-only: this script only ever calls `bd show`/`bd list`, never a bd
# write. The caller (/land Section 4) is the one that runs `bd label add`.
