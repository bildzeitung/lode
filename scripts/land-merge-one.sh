# Merge a single accepted `land/<id>` branch onto the current checkout with its
# pre-computed commit message, retrying once past a re-staged passive beads
# export -- see `scripts/beads-passive-exports.txt` for the canonical list of
# such exports (import.auto: false, lode-6ra -- never real work). Extracted
# per lode-sfnb: `/land`'s Section 3 merge loop
# used to define this as an inline bash FUNCTION (`merge_one()`) and read a
# bash ASSOCIATIVE ARRAY (`MSG`) populated by a separate, earlier fenced code
# block in .claude/skills/land/SKILL.md. Those are two different Bash tool
# invocations -- the harness does not carry shell state (variables, arrays, or
# function definitions) between them -- so by the time the merge loop ran,
# `MSG` was empty and `merge_one` may not even exist, and the failure was
# SILENT (an empty-message merge, or an unrelated-looking error with no
# output). OBSERVED landing the 2026-07-26 lode-ns3r/lode-1q2i/lode-sys4 pass.
# A script on disk has no such problem: it is available identically to every
# Bash invocation that calls it, with no bash state to redeclare.
#
# Usage: scripts/land-merge-one.sh <id> <land-msg-dir> [own-token]
#
#   <id>            -- the bd ticket id whose `origin/land/<id>` branch is
#                      about to be merged into the current checkout (trunk).
#   <land-msg-dir>  -- a directory containing one file per id, named exactly
#                      `<land-msg-dir>/<id>`, whose full content (verbatim) is
#                      the merge commit message. Written once, ahead of any
#                      merge, by /land's Section 3a precompute step -- this
#                      script never calls `bd` itself, so the "one bd-show
#                      pass instead of N subprocess calls per merge" property
#                      lode-bns3 established stays intact.
#   [own-token]     -- OPTIONAL: the current /land pass's own remembered
#                      `scripts/land-lock.sh acquire` token (lode-q9pm),
#                      threaded straight through to this script's own
#                      heartbeat call below so it can refuse to overwrite a
#                      lock this pass no longer owns. Omit it to reproduce
#                      the pre-lode-q9pm blind heartbeat (no ownership
#                      check) -- see scripts/land-lock.sh's own header for
#                      what supplying it does and does not change.
#
# Exit codes -- same 0/1/2 convention as scripts/merge-precheck.sh and
# scripts/validate-mermaid.sh (lode-9i2p's rule: exit 2 is a MACHINE/setup
# fault, never a branch's content, and must never be read as a conflict or a
# reason to bounce):
#
#   0 -- merged cleanly (on the first attempt, or after the jsonl-restore
#        retry). Nothing on stdout.
#   1 -- a REAL textual conflict. The conflicting path(s) (one per line, no
#        other chatter) are printed to STDOUT for the caller to capture as
#        $CONFLICTS -- e.g. `CONFLICTS=$(scripts/land-merge-one.sh "$id"
#        "$MSG_DIR")`. The merge is already aborted (working tree left clean)
#        before this script returns.
#   2 -- could not even attempt the merge: bad usage, cwd is not lode's main
#        checkout -- or that guard could not run at all (lode-1nty, see
#        below; the two are distinguished in the diagnostic, never conflated),
#        a missing/empty message file for
#        <id> (Section 3a's precompute did not run, or did not cover this
#        id), or an unexpected git failure that is neither the retryable
#        jsonl trap nor a real conflict (an empty `git ls-files -u` yet the
#        merge still failed). Stderr names the cause. This is the "LOUD, never
#        a silent empty-message merge" acceptance criterion -- refusing here
#        is exactly what closes lode-sfnb's failure mode.
#
# MAIN-CHECKOUT IDENTITY (lode-1nty): every git call below --
# `git merge --no-ff`, `git restore --staged --worktree`, `git merge --abort`
# -- is cwd-resolved, with no `-C`/`--git-dir` of its own pinning it to a
# specific checkout. This script therefore asserts its own main-checkout
# identity (`scripts/assert-main-checkout.sh`) as its first real action,
# below, folding any failure into its exit-2 contract -- rather than relying
# on each call site to fence-guard it, which is a discipline every future
# caller would have had to remember independently. NO CALLER NEEDS TO FENCE
# THIS SCRIPT; a caller with cwd-resolved mutations of its OWN still needs
# its own guard. Do NOT list the call sites here -- the same roster went
# stale within one ticket of being written in assert-main-checkout.sh's
# header, which is why neither script keeps one now. Full decision and
# reasoning: docs/agents-workflow.md's main-checkout section.
#
# Never touches bd, never pushes, never runs a gate -- purely the merge step,
# plus one side effect: it heartbeats the single-lander lock (lode-m87j) via
# `scripts/land-lock.sh heartbeat`, best-effort and non-fatal, so that a
# lock's staleness check measures idle time rather than the whole pass's
# duration -- see that script's own header for the full mechanism.
# The caller (the /land skill) decides what a 1 or a 2 means for the pass.

# the token's age then reflects the gap since the last branch merged, not
