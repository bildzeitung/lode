"""Build the on-demand SQLite FTS5 index over ``docs/*.md`` (``lode-t6o1.2``).

Takes the chunker's units (``scripts/docs_index_chunker.py``, ``lode-t6o1.1``)
and loads them into an FTS5 virtual table, per the decided shape recorded in
``docs/decisions.md`` (entry ``lode-t6o1``; epic ``lode-t6o1``'s Design
field). This module is *only* the build step; the query CLI is
``lode-t6o1.3``.

Two structural constraints, both settled and non-negotiable here:

- **stdlib ``sqlite3`` FTS5 only** -- no new dependency, and this module does
  not import or depend on lode's own embedding/FTS retrieval pipeline
  (``src/lode/retrieval.py``, ``embedding.py``, ``vectorstore.py``). See the
  epic's SETTLED item 4: pointing lode's own retrieval at lode's own design
  record would make "what did we decide about retrieval" unanswerable
  precisely when retrieval is broken or mid-refactor.
- **Full rebuild on every invocation, no cache.** Measured 26-35 ms for the
  whole 1.26 MB corpus (329 units) during the epic's ``/challenge`` -- see
  :func:`build_index`'s docstring for a fresh measurement recorded on this
  ticket. The trigger to revisit is ~500 ms, not the originally-stated 2 s
  (60x current, would never fire).

The build target is a temp/XDG cache dir OUTSIDE the repository worktree --
one of the two mechanisms enforcing the never-tracked constraint (the other
is the gate test, ``lode-t6o1.4``, sibling ticket). :func:`cache_db_path`
resolves it with the stdlib alone: ``$XDG_CACHE_HOME/lode/docs-index.sqlite3``
if set, else ``~/.cache/lode/docs-index.sqlite3`` -- the same fallback
``platformdirs`` would compute on Linux/macOS, without adding a dependency
that is today only a transitive pull-in of ``fastembed`` (i.e. of the very
retrieval pipeline this module must stay independent of).

    the registration is permanent for the session and a second load under
