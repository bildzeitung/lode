# lode — Open decisions (deferred, not forgotten)

*(§9)* Decisions deliberately left open, with the current leaning where there is one. Revisit each
when the build reaches the feature that forces it. The tunable parameters several of these reference
are catalogued in [configuration.md](configuration.md).

- **External refresh: on-access revalidation vs. scheduled background refresh.** Leaning
  **on-access with a short TTL cache** for a single instance with finite API quota — but it's
  really a per-source judgment (a closed ticket changes rarely; an active PR changes hourly).
  Decide per connector when building it. ([externals.md](externals.md#the-broken-assumption-external-staleness-is-not-topological))
- **History compaction / squash policy.** Not needed for years; revisit if storage matters.
  ([storage.md](storage.md#identity-vs-version))
- **Minimal / archival backup export.** v1 backup is `cp lode.db` — a superset copy that drags
  rebuildable cache (harmless). A true irreplaceable-only dump is a row-level `lode export` (owned
  tables + `source = user` rows), with restore rebuilding the cache via reconciliation + re-embed/
  re-enrich ([stack.md](stack.md#the-partition-is-by-rows-not-by-file)). Deferred — the superset
  copy is correct and free; build the export only if a minimal dump is actually wanted.
- **Cache rebuild cost is non-uniform** ([stack.md](stack.md#the-derived-layer-is-not-uniformly-disposable)).
  Embeddings / lexical / explicit edges rebuild cheaply (local, minutes); AI annotations + inferred
  edges cost real dollars + hours (Claude Batches) to regenerate from scratch. Decide whether to
  *snapshot* the LLM tier of the cache purely to skip recompute on restore — not for correctness,
  only to dodge the cost.
- **LanceDB maturity.** Younger / faster-moving than the rest of the stack; acceptable because the
  cache is disposable and lives behind the repository interface. Watch for breaking changes;
  sqlite-vec is the simpler fallback-down if it churns too hard.
- **Span-annotation fuzzy re-anchor threshold** — tune when span annotations are actually built.
  ([storage.md](storage.md#anchoring-strategy))
- **Local-LLM fallback for `no_egress` notes.** v1 marks sensitive notes/sources `no_egress`: they
  are locally retrievable but excluded from cloud enrichment + Q&A and cited as "withheld from
  synthesis" ([externals.md](externals.md#privacy-consequence-of-aggregation)). A future option is a
  **local generative model** that could enrich and synthesize over withheld notes entirely on-box, so
  they participate in answers without egress. Deferred — it needs a local LLM (quality/latency hit)
  and is a large scope addition; decide if the "withheld" gap proves too limiting in practice.
- **Redact-before-egress pattern set.** What counts as an "obvious secret" stripped before content is
  sent to Claude (keys, tokens, `.env` shapes, PII?) is a rule set that will need iterating; start
  with high-precision patterns to avoid mangling legitimate content, expand from real misses.
- **Substring/span redaction** (upgrade to the [hard delete](externals.md#hard-delete-the-deliberate-immutability-break-corrective-half)).
  v1 purges at version/note granularity; surgical "redact this string everywhere it appears, keep
  the rest of the note" is deferred as YAGNI. Revisit if coarse purge proves too lossy in practice.
- **Faithfulness entailment threshold (ships untuned, must be revisited).** v1 verifies citations
  deterministically (verbatim-span + extractive coupling) **and** runs a local NLI / cross-encoder
  **entailment check** so genuine multi-note synthesis is *answered*, not refused
  ([retrieval.md](retrieval.md#faithfulness-verify-citations-dont-just-require-them)). The stage and a
  default model ship in v1, deliberately **conservative and fail-closed**. The open knob is the
  **model choice + acceptance threshold**: too loose readmits unsupported synthesis (mode 4), too
  tight collapses to extractive-only. It cannot be set honestly without data, so tune it against the
  eval harness once there's a real corpus; treat v1 synthesis answers as capability-present,
  quality-untuned. An LLM-judge second pass remains an optional high-assurance toggle (off by
  default — round-trip + $ + off-box).
- **Chunk size + overlap.** Passages are structure-aware with a token-window fallback
  ([retrieval.md](retrieval.md#chunking-passages-are-the-retrieval-unit)); the fallback threshold
  `N` and the overlap are tuning knobs. Too small fragments context and citations; too large
  re-introduces the recall dilution chunking was meant to fix. Pick a sane default (e.g. ~256–512
  tokens) and tune against the eval harness — passages are regenerable, so re-chunking with new
  parameters is a cheap local rebuild.
- **Eval harness for retrieval + faithfulness — scheduled for build step 1.** A small held-out Q&A
  set (~20–50 questions with known-good citations) scored on retrieval recall@k, citation/faithfulness
  accuracy, and abstention correctness. It is **no longer deferred** — it ships in step 1
  ([design.md](design.md) §7) because three knobs (rerank, the entailment threshold, chunk size) all
  tune against it. **Determinism — settled (lode-5y8.1):** the scorer
  (`lode.eval.harness.score_golden_set`) is reproducible for a fixed corpus because it injects two
  seams. Retrieval is model-free in the lexical leg (FTS5/BM25) and deterministic in the dense leg
  (local embeddings), so **recall@k is corpus-deterministic** — and it is the leg that scores real
  seed prose even with a stubbed embedder. The Q&A LLM call is *not* deterministic, so the
  faithfulness/abstention legs are sourced through an injected **answerer** seam (the same mock seam
  `cited_answer.ask` / `qa.answer_question` already expose via their `client` parameter): a fixed
  answerer over a fixed corpus yields a fixed score. Tests inject deterministic stubs and never hit
  the network; production wires the real embedder + a real-client `ask`. **Command + CI wiring —
  settled (lode-5y8.2), then re-settled (Shape A, lode-5y8.5):** the original wiring shipped eval as
  a top-level `lode eval` command (`src/lode/cli.py`) that ran the scorer against a fresh ephemeral
  store and printed the three metrics. **Re-decided (Shape A, supersedes lode-5y8.2):** eval is a
  maintainer/CI **integration test in a live-like state**, not an end-user feature, so it is **no
  longer a shipped CLI command**. The `lode eval` subcommand is removed from `src/lode/cli.py` (and
  from the E10 shipped surface, lode-y42); the live-wiring entry point moves to a `tests/`
  integration test (`tests/test_eval_live.py`) that `nox -s eval` runs. Rationale: Python extras only
  gate *dependencies* — `lode[dev]` decides whether fastembed/anthropic/test deps are installed, not
  which first-party modules ship — so a `lode eval` command would land in the base wheel for every
  end user regardless of extras. Relocating the live entry point into `tests/` keeps it out of *every*
  shipped wheel while preserving its value as a real-seam integration check; the `dev` extra carries
  the deps needed to run it. It still scores against a fresh ephemeral store (in-memory SQLite + a
  throwaway LanceDB dir — never the user's notes) over the *real* seams — the local ONNX embedder
  (`FastEmbedEmbedder`) and a real-client answerer (`cited_answer.ask`) — so its Q&A leg needs
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and the network, and stays **out** of the offline test gate: the noxfile keeps
  `nox.options.sessions = ["fix", "tests"]` so a bare `nox` and `nox -s tests` stay offline + keyless,
  and the `nox -s eval` session is the explicit, credential-gated CI-style check — it `skip`s itself
  when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is absent rather than failing or hitting the network. The deterministic
  offline scorer tests (`tests/test_eval_*.py`, stubbed seams) are unchanged, and
  `lode.eval.harness.score_golden_set` stays a library function shared by both the offline stub tests
  and the live integration test. Knock-on: the Phase-A exit gate (lode-6w1 / lode-6w1.1) wording
  moves from "`lode eval` runs green" to "the `nox -s eval` integration test runs green." **Pass bar,
  metric weighting, and golden-set curation — settled (lode-7lp).** The harness previously shipped
  with no quality floor (`tests/test_eval_live.py` asserted only that each metric fell in `[0, 1]`, so
  even 0% recall passed); a live baseline is now recorded and enforced. **Weighting: independent
  per-metric floors, not a combined score.** Recall@k, faithfulness, and abstention measure distinct
  failure modes (retrieval missed the note vs. the answer cited the wrong thing vs. the system
  answered/abstained wrongly) and a single blended score would let a collapse in one metric hide
  behind headroom in the other two — exactly the silent-regression risk this ticket exists to close.
  Each of the three metrics in `tests/test_eval_live.py` must independently clear its own floor for
  `nox -s eval` to pass. **Baseline (recorded 2026-07-02, two independent live runs against the
  committed golden fixture, `k=20`):** recall@20 = 1.000, faithfulness/citation accuracy = 1.000,
  abstention correctness = 1.000 — all stable across both runs. **Floors: 0.95 per metric**, a
  one-item margin below the perfect baseline (24/25 = 0.960 clears it, 23/25 = 0.920 does not, on the
  25-item answerable population; the 33-item abstention population has more headroom still) to absorb
  the live Q&A leg's run-to-run sampling variance without masking a real multi-item regression. Floors
  are recorded as named constants (`RECALL_FLOOR`, `FAITHFULNESS_FLOOR`, `ABSTENTION_FLOOR`) next to
  the assertions in `tests/test_eval_live.py`, not only here, so a future re-baseline finds them
  in-context. **Golden-set curation policy:** the set is maintainer-curated, not auto-generated or
  crowd-sourced — every item is hand-authored against the committed seed corpus (`src/lode/eval/`),
  with each citation's verbatim span mechanically checked against the cited note's body
  (`tests/test_eval_golden.py`) so a stale or fabricated quote fails loudly rather than drifting. It
  grows the same way: a new question is added only alongside the seed-corpus note(s) it targets (or as
  a new out-of-corpus item for abstention coverage), and a re-baseline (rerun both `nox -s eval` and
  this entry) follows any change that could move the recorded metrics — a new item, a seed-corpus edit,
  or a retrieval/answerer knob change. The set intentionally stays small (~20–50 items, current: 25
  answerable + 8 abstain) so it remains fully hand-auditable; it is a regression harness for the
  tuning knobs (rerank, entailment threshold, chunk size), not a statistically powered benchmark.
- **Rerank model + threshold tuning.** The rerank *stage* ships in v1 ([retrieval.md](retrieval.md))
  with a default local cross-encoder behind a toggle; choosing/tuning the model and cutoffs — and
  A/B'ing rerank vs none — waits until there's a real corpus to evaluate against. Don't tune
  pre-data.
- **`$LODE_HOME` on-disk layout (settled); migration moot — no install base.** The on-disk layout
  is a single root, `$LODE_HOME` (default `~/.lode`), holding the DB, lock, `lancedb/`, `logs/`, and
  optional `config.toml` ([configuration.md](configuration.md#paths--locations)) — replacing the old
  XDG-style `~/.local/share/lode/lode.db` (`$LODE_DB`) binding (lode-qd9). The data-migration question
  lode-qd9 raised (auto-move-if-present vs document a manual move for existing
  `~/.local/share/lode` data) is **resolved as not-applicable: there is no install base, so there is
  no on-disk data to migrate** — qd9's "`$LODE_HOME` for new installs, no auto-move" is the complete
  fix, and the discovered-from migration ticket (lode-qfp) is closed as moot. If a deployed install
  base ever predates a path change again, re-open the move-vs-document question then.
- **`lode --debug` coupled to DEBUG log level (accepted tradeoff, split deferred).** The top-level
  `lode --debug` flag (lode-1i8.3) ties log **verbosity** to diagnostic **feature-enablement**:
  passing it forces the root logger to `DEBUG` for that invocation, and every DEBUG-gated diagnostic
  (e.g. the TUI's event-loop-lag `latency_probe`, lode-0wj.2) checks that same level to decide
  whether to run — there is no separate "enable this diagnostic" switch
  ([configuration.md](configuration.md#paths--locations) `lode --debug` row). **Accepted tradeoff:**
  one flag, one concept — simplest thing that works, at the cost of always paying DEBUG-level log
  volume to get the diagnostics, and vice versa. **Split trigger:** revisit if a future debug feature
  needs enabling *without* DEBUG-level log spam (a diagnostic cheap enough to always want on, but
  DEBUG logging is too noisy to also flip on), or the reverse (DEBUG logging wanted without enabling
  every diagnostic) — then decouple verbosity from feature-enablement into two flags/knobs. Until
  one of those forces it, the coupling stands.
- **Landing loop — architecture + mechanics settled; two future upgrades noted.** The whole landing
  loop is decided in
  [agents-workflow.md](agents-workflow.md#the-landing-loop--build-review-land-planned) — all landing
  through one `/land`, split technical/semantic review, the `ready-for-land` **label**, minimal
  landing context (head SHA + summary), `land/<ticket-id>` branches, and the v1 single-lander lock (a
  local "skip if running" guard + the one-machine convention). Deferred, *not* blocking v1: (1) a
  **distributed remote-lock ref** (`refs/locks/land`, owner + timestamp for stale-break) to replace
  the v1 guard once true concurrent multi-machine landing is wanted — the seam toward real CI; (2) a
  **stale-escalation sweep** to GC `land/<id>` branches left behind by tickets awaiting a human
  decision.
- **`bd dolt push` retry-on-reject: a backoff wrapper, not a Dolt server-mode migration (lode-83d).**
  lode-nps.3 validated that `bd dolt push` is fast-forward-only + atomically CAS-protected on the
  branch ref (a losing concurrent writer is *rejected*, never silently dropped) but surfaced two
  gaps: no call site retried a rejection, and lode's **embedded** (in-process Dolt engine) mode is
  documented by beads itself as single-writer-via-file-lock, the wrong mode for `/code`'s
  multi-producer fan-out, whose failure mode is a hard "database is locked" error with no built-in
  retry. **Decision: fix both with one mechanism — a shared backoff-and-retry wrapper
  (`scripts/bd-dolt-push.sh`), not a switch to Dolt server mode.** Every literal `bd dolt push` call
  site across the skills (`.claude/agents/coding.md`, `.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md`,
  `.claude/skills/land/SKILL.md`, `.claude/skills/epic-audit/SKILL.md`) now calls the wrapper
  instead: on a non-zero exit it runs `bd dolt pull` (folds in the winner's commit so a rejected push
  has a shot at fast-forwarding on retry) and retries with exponential backoff + jitter (default 5
  attempts, ~2s/4s/8s/16s base delays, `BD_DOLT_PUSH_MAX_ATTEMPTS` / `BD_DOLT_PUSH_BASE_DELAY`
  override the defaults), surfacing the final failure's exit code if every attempt is exhausted.
  **Follow-up (lode-bpl): that enumeration was itself prefix-blind** — it greped
  `"rtk bd dolt push"`, missing any call site written without the `rtk` prefix. A prefix-agnostic
  re-audit found and wrapped two more unattended-loop call sites (`land/SKILL.md`'s exit-(a)
  re-entry step, `sweep/SKILL.md`'s publish step) and confirmed three deliberate exemptions —
  `debate/SKILL.md` (human-invoked/interactive, a failed push is observed), `.beads/README.md` and
  `AGENTS.md` (generic beads-generated quick-reference prose, not automated call sites). See the
  "Concurrent `bd dolt push` under fan-out" section in [agents-workflow.md](agents-workflow.md) for
  the full inventory.
  **Why not switch to Dolt server mode:** it's the operationally heavier fix — every contributor
  machine would need a running `dolt sql-server` process, port/credential config, and a lifecycle
  story (start on session begin, survive across worktrees, restart on crash) before any producer
  could write bd state at all; a single-repo, single-machine, short-lived-lock workload doesn't
  warrant that infrastructure. Embedded mode's lock window is one bd operation (milliseconds to low
  seconds), well inside the wrapper's backoff schedule — a few seconds of retry absorbs contention
  from `/code`'s N-producer fan-out without a new daemon to run, monitor, or fail. **Revisit if:**
  lock contention or push rejections become a *frequent* rather than occasional event (i.e. the
  wrapper's default 5-attempt budget starts exhausting under normal fan-out width, not just an
  unlucky race), or lode's contributor base grows to where a shared always-on Dolt server earns its
  keep for reasons beyond this ticket's concurrency concern.
