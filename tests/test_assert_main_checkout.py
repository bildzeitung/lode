"""Tests for scripts/assert-main-checkout.sh (lode-pcee).

`/land`'s Section 1 used to run its `checkout -f trunk` through
`git -C "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"`, on the theory that the `-C`
pinned the command to lode's main checkout. It did not: `--show-toplevel`
resolves relative to CWD, so the value it produces is always wherever the
process already is -- in the main checkout that made the `-C` a no-op
(redundant, not wrong); in a linked worktree it resolved to THAT WORKTREE's
own root, never the main checkout, because a `-C` computed from cwd cannot
redirect a command to a *different* directory than the one it is already
running in. That reads as a safety guard and is not one. The genuinely
destructive line two lines later -- `git reset --hard origin/trunk` --
carried no `-C` at all, so run from a worktree it would hard-reset THAT
WORKTREE's own branch, destroying any uncommitted work there with nothing in
`git reflog` to recover it (discarded commits are recoverable; discarded
uncommitted work is not). `/land` is defined to run only in the main
checkout, so this was latent, not live -- but a guard that looks like
protection and provides none is worse than no guard.

This script replaces the `-C` idiom with an IDENTITY check:
`git rev-parse --git-common-dir` returns the one `.git` directory every
worktree of a repo shares, main checkout included, so the main checkout's
own toplevel is that directory's parent and a linked worktree's toplevel
never is. Unlike `--show-toplevel`, that value does not depend on which
worktree the process happens to be standing in, which is what makes it
usable to DISTINGUISH the two rather than just restate wherever cwd already
is.

All tests here run the ACTUAL `scripts/assert-main-checkout.sh` against real
git repositories (including real `git worktree add` checkouts and a real
submodule) built in `tmp_path` -- no fake git, no mocked subprocess --
sabotage-provable per the lode-verb bar: reverting the script back to
comparing `--show-toplevel` against itself would turn the worktree-refusal
test below green for the wrong reason, but the submodule/layout test would
catch a script that assumes `--git-common-dir` always ends in `/.git`.

The SEPARATE text-gate half that used to live in this module -- assertions
against `.claude/skills/land/SKILL.md`'s fenced ```bash blocks, running no
script and touching no repo -- moved to `tests/test_land_skill_guard_coverage.
py` (lode-2thl), alongside the other SKILL.md-text gates it actually
resembles.
