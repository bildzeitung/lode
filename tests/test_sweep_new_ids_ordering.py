"""Regression pin for lode-fm7t: `.claude/skills/sweep/SKILL.md` Section 7 must
consume `$SWEEP_TMP/new_ids` -- persisted by Section 5 BEFORE Section 6 rewrites
the digest body -- rather than re-deriving the delta from the digest description,
which by the time Section 7 runs is the body Section 6 just wrote.

THE BUG. Section 5 computes `NEW_IDS = comm -13 LAST_IDS CURRENT_IDS`, where
`LAST_IDS` comes from parsing `SWEEP-ITEM` lines out of the digest issue's
description. Section 6 then rewrites that description wholesale from
`$CURRENT`. Section 7 -- a separate Bash tool invocation, so nothing from
Section 5 survives (lode-sfnb/lode-x495, this file's own governing rule) --
used to re-derive `NEW_IDS` by re-running the SAME computation. But by then the
digest body it reads is the one Section 6 just wrote, so `LAST_IDS ==
CURRENT_IDS` by construction and `NEW_IDS` was ALWAYS EMPTY -- no push, no
`## NEW HUMAN-DECISION ITEMS` report block, ever, on exactly the passes where
the queue actually changed.

WHY A TEXTUAL PIN IS NOT ENOUGH (lode-fm7t acceptance #5). A test that merely
greps Section 7's fenced block for the substring `$SWEEP_TMP/new_ids` would
have passed on the OLD, broken text too -- Section 7 always wrote that path
(as an output, from its own broken re-derivation). The property that actually
matters is an ORDERING one: Section 7's `$SWEEP_TMP/push_ids` must reflect the
delta AS SEEN BEFORE Section 6's rewrite, not after. The only way
to pin that mechanically is to run the real extracted blocks in the order an
agent actually executes them -- one fresh subprocess per fenced block, exactly
as `docs/agents-workflow.md`'s cross-block-shell-state rule describes -- with a
fake `bd` whose `bd show <digest-id>` response is swapped mid-test to model
Section 6 having already run. `test_section_7_reddens_if_restored_to_reading_the_digest_body`
below proves the pin actually catches the regression: it reimplements the OLD,
broken Section 7 shape and asserts it fails these same assertions.

Same fake-`bd`-on-PATH-plus-real-script pattern as tests/test_sweep_digest_id.py
and tests/test_epic_children_closed.py. Block extraction is
tests/conftest.py::bash_fence_blocks (lode-kjei) -- the same parser
tests/test_land_conflicts_state.py uses for the same reason: preserve fenced
block BOUNDARIES, since whether `$NEW_IDS` is read from a file or re-derived
from a bash variable/digest read is a per-block question.
