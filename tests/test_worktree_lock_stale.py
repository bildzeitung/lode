"""Tests for scripts/worktree-lock-stale.sh (lode-yrtu).

/land's Section 4 worktree-GC backstop skips every `locked` worktree
unconditionally, before any other predicate runs. The lock the Claude Code
harness records (every `isolation: "worktree"` launch worktree, plus
`.claude/agents/coding.md`'s own explicit pre-first-commit lock) is
PER-SESSION, not per-agent -- measured live: several worktrees can share ONE
lock-owner pid. A dead session therefore leaves every worktree it ever locked
stuck behind the `locked` check forever, since nothing downstream ever runs.

This script decides whether a `git worktree lock` reason (e.g. "claude agent
agent-<hash> (pid 1838142 start 76727921)") is STALE -- the recorded pid is
gone, or has been reused by an unrelated later process (detected via
`/proc/<pid>/stat`'s own `starttime`, matched against the token recorded at
lock time) -- or must still be treated as LIVE.

All tests exercise the ACTUAL script against REAL processes and REAL
`/proc/<pid>/stat` files -- no fake `/proc`, no mocked subprocess -- so a
broken pid/token regex, a broken `awk` field split, or a flipped exit-code
convention directly flips one of these tests red (sabotage-provable per the
lode-verb bar). The "reused pid" case is simulated by taking a REAL, running
process's REAL reason text and substituting a start token that does not
match its actual `/proc/<pid>/stat` starttime -- genuine OS-level pid reuse
cannot be forced deterministically, but a token mismatch is exactly what the
script is designed to detect regardless of how the mismatch arose.
