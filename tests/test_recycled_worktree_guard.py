"""Tests for scripts/recycled-worktree-guard.sh (lode-ivth, lode-isl3).

The recycled-worktree guard (lode-nt98) used to be a ~15-line inline bash
block duplicated at FOUR sites (.claude/agents/coding.md x2,
.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md x1, .claude/agents/land-review.md x1) --
shell in a markdown fence gets neither shellcheck nor a unit test, and the
four copies had already started to drift from each other (lode-qv5t added a
`.claude/worktrees/` precondition and a rescue-branch line to two of them but
not the third). This extracts the guard to one script so it is covered by
`nox -s shellcheck` and this suite.

lode-isl3: the guard's predicate and remedy now read `origin/trunk`, never
bare (local) `trunk`. Worktrees share `refs/heads/`, so bare `trunk` is the
MAIN CHECKOUT's local `trunk` branch -- and `/land` leaves that ref carrying
un-pushed, un-gated `--no-ff` merges for the entire window between its merge
loop and its push, on the HEALTHY path, not just a crash path. Every repo
built here therefore gets a real `origin` remote (a bare repo in `tmp_path`)
so local `trunk` and `origin/trunk` can be made to diverge exactly the way a
live `/land` pass diverges them -- tests that only ever pushed immediately
could not exercise the residue window this ticket is about at all.

All tests run the ACTUAL `scripts/recycled-worktree-guard.sh` against real
git repositories (with real `git worktree add` checkouts and a real `origin`
remote) built in `tmp_path` -- no fake git, no mocked subprocess --
sabotage-provable per the lode-verb bar: reverting the script's `case` guard,
its ancestor check, its `origin/trunk` reads, or its rescue-branch line
directly would turn the corresponding test here red.
