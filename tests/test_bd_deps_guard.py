"""The committed PreToolUse(Bash) guard against bd's inverted `blocks:` edge (lode-0kbq).

`bd create --deps blocks:<id>` does NOT make the new ticket blocked by <id> — it inverts,
recording <id> as blocked by the NEW ticket. That silently drops a parent out of `bd ready`
behind its own follow-up (lode-ij24). Docs proved advisory, so `.claude/settings.json` carries
a PreToolUse hook that denies the bad form and prints the two-step remedy.

These tests execute the hook *as shipped* — extracted from the real settings.json and run
exactly as the harness runs it (payload on stdin) — because the guard's failure mode is silent
UNDER-matching, and its regex has already been wrong four times: it once carried an
`else` arm emitting permissionDecision "allow" (auto-approving every Bash call in the repo);
it once denied harmless prose that merely quoted the bad form; it once missed the `bd new`
alias entirely; and it once matched only within a single physical line, silently missing every
backslash-continued `bd create` — the NORMAL shape for a real call with a `--title`/`--description`
(lode-m6px). That last one is not hypothetical: it reached the live DB on 2026-07-17. Nothing but
a test table catches the next one.

The guard deliberately OVER-matches. A regex cannot parse shell quoting, so it cannot tell a ';'
inside a `--description` from one separating two statements; lode-oii9 settles the tiebreak for
this hook — when it cannot evaluate, it denies. Hence DENIED carries prose-with-metacharacter
cases and ACCEPTED_FALSE_DENIES pins the over-match we pay for them (lode-m6px, docs/decisions.md).

CRITICAL (lode-9gm2): the hook runs under the Claude Code harness's `/bin/sh`, which on Linux is
**dash**, not bash — and dash rejects bash-only constructs (`${var//pat/repl}` pattern
substitution, `$'...'` ANSI-C quoting) with a hard "Bad substitution" error that bricks the Bash
tool for the rest of the session (lode-m6px's first attempt shipped exactly that, verified green
by a test suite that drove the hook through `bash -c` and so could not see the defect). Every
test below therefore drives the hook through `/bin/sh -c`, never `bash -c` — that is the whole
point: a test using bash cannot catch this class of bug, which is exactly how it shipped once
already.
