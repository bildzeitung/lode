"""Tests for scripts/epic-children-closed.sh (lode-v4rk).

Shared "are this epic's parent-child children ALL closed" check, factored out
because three skills each carried their OWN inline copy of the same broken
derivation: `/land`'s Section-4 epic-completion flag, `/epic-audit`'s
"confirm from live state" gate, and `/sweep`'s "epics ready for a human
close-decision" step. All three read `bd show <epic-id> --json`'s
`.dependents[]` array, which `bd show` only populates with the opt-in
`--include-dependents` flag -- verified live against bd 1.1.0:
`dependent_count` is non-zero but the `dependents` key is entirely absent
without the flag. So every one of the three call sites always saw an empty
`$kids`, and the `(($kids|length)>0)` false-positive guard always tripped
short -- dead code in three places, all failing silently safe.

`test_old_dependents_derivation_never_fires_even_when_fully_closed` runs the
OLD shared snippet's logic directly and asserts it produces nothing. Note what
its fixture can and cannot express: the children are closed *in the modeled
DB*, but that is deliberately NOT observable in the payload, because the whole
bug is that `bd show` omits the `dependents` key entirely (only
`dependent_count: 2` survives). The old snippet therefore cannot distinguish
"no children" from "children it wasn't given" -- which is exactly why it failed
silently. That test is a pinned DEMONSTRATION of the old bug, not a regression
guard: it embeds the dead snippet inline and so passes no matter what this
repo's scripts do (verified: it still passes with the scripts deleted outright).

The actual guards are the three tests that exercise the replacement script via
a fake `bd` on PATH -- they are what fails if the derivation regresses (verified
by reverting the script to the `.dependents[]` form: all three fail). That is
the test satisfying the ticket's bar, "a test that FAILS against today's
empty-$kids derivation". Same fake-`bd` pattern as
tests/test_epic_debate_gate.py and tests/test_epic_completion_check.py.

This module's `_fake_bd` is deliberately NOT unified with
tests/test_blocks_dependents.py's and tests/test_epic_completion_check.py's --
see the "RATIFIED DEFERRAL" paragraph in test_blocks_dependents.py's
docstring for the reasoning (lode-863q, ratified by lode-ea5b).
