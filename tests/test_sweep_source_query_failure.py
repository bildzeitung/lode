"""Regression pin for lode-5qbi: `.claude/skills/sweep/SKILL.md` Sections 1 and 2
must DETECT a failed `bd`/`jq` source query -- and must not report failure when
the query succeeded.

THE BUG BEING PINNED. Section 6 rewrites the durable digest issue WHOLESALE from
`$CURRENT`. Measured on bd 1.1.0, a failing `bd list` writes its diagnostic to
stderr and ZERO bytes to stdout, so in `VAR=$(bd ... | jq ...)` without
`set -o pipefail`, jq reads no input, emits nothing, and exits 0 -- the
assignment reports success, `$CURRENT` comes out empty, and the rewrite deletes
every real human-decision item from the record. Section 2 additionally used
`while read ... < <(bd ... | jq ...)`, whose exit status is `read`'s, never the
pipeline's, so no `pipefail` setting could have surfaced it there.

BOTH DIRECTIONS ARE PINNED, and the healthy-path one is not decoration -- see
`test_successful_pass_writes_no_marker_and_exits_zero` for the specific inverted
signal it exists to catch, which a static grep for `pipefail` would pass.

Same fake-`bd`-on-PATH-plus-real-fenced-block pattern as
tests/test_sweep_new_ids_ordering.py; block extraction is
tests/conftest.py::bash_fence_blocks (lode-kjei).
