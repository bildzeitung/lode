"""Tests for scripts/validate-sha40.sh (lode-xdg3).

During the /code fan-out of 2026-08-08, a rebase pickup (lode-r9z0) wrote a
39-character `land_head` into bd metadata -- one hex digit short of the real
branch tip. Nothing in the pipeline would have caught it: `/land`'s Section
2a precheck and `code-reviewer.md`'s own `review_head` check both compare
the recorded value against the *actual* branch tip purely to detect DRIFT (a
push after the ticket was marked ready) -- a malformed value never equals a
real SHA either, so it would have been silently misread as drift and kicked
the branch back `needs-rebase` for no reason, on a branch that was already
correct.

`scripts/validate-sha40.sh` gives both read sites one shared, tested
predicate: is this value even shaped like a full 40-lowercase-hex git SHA,
BEFORE it is ever compared against a real branch tip. All tests below run
the actual script via subprocess -- no re-implementation of the regex in
Python that could itself drift from what the shipped script does.
