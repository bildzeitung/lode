"""Tests for scripts/land-lock.sh (lode-aps3, lode-ao95, lode-y3dw).

WHY the trap-and-PID design this replaces could not work -- an agent runs
each fenced `bash` block of `.claude/skills/land/SKILL.md` as its own Bash
invocation, so a `trap ... EXIT` fires before the next section runs and a
recorded PID is *always* already dead -- and why the replacement is a
wall-clock staleness token: see the header comment of scripts/land-lock.sh.
That rationale is deliberately NOT restated here (the
tests/test_blocks_dependents.py precedent) -- it lives next to the code it
constrains, so it cannot drift out of sync with a second copy. The header
also records the mechanism's known limits: the `heartbeat` subcommand
(lode-m87j) moves the TTL toward idle-time semantics over the two loops it
brackets, plus (lode-v4sv) two boundary call sites that close the two
originally-uncovered stretches that grew with queue size -- but not over the
whole pass; CAVEAT 1 enumerates the one stretch that still stays uncovered
(Section 3's combined re-gate, which does not grow with queue size) and why
the 1800s default was therefore left alone. The stale-lock reclaim path
(CAVEAT 2) is now closed OUTRIGHT via
`flock(1)` (lode-y3dw) -- see that section of the header for why the earlier
mkdir-gate design (lode-ao95, lode-78ih) could narrow but never fully close
it -- and the record's owner token (5th field) is both preserved across
heartbeat calls and -- since lode-q9pm -- compared against the calling pass's
own remembered token, so `heartbeat`/`release` refuse to touch a record this
pass no longer owns. That comparison is skipped when the caller omits its
token, which is why the SKILL.md call-site pins near the bottom of this file
gate that every real call site supplies one.

What this file adds on top of that is the regression gate, in four parts:

1. Behavioural tests that run the ACTUAL script against a real, throwaway
   git repository in `tmp_path` (its only external dependency is
   `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`, to place the lock under the repo's
   shared `.git/` -- repo-global rather than worktree-private, lode-xkpd) --
   no fake git, no mocked subprocess. Reintroducing either half of the old
   design turns these red: a `trap` release makes
   `test_second_acquire_without_release_is_skipped_while_fresh` fail (the
   lock is gone by the next invocation), and a `kill -0` liveness check
   makes `test_fresh_lock_with_an_unreachable_pid_is_not_reclaimed` fail.
   Both mutations were run against this file and confirmed red (5 and 6
   failures of the 14 behavioural tests that existed when that was measured).
   Two tests pin the repo-global lock path (lode-xkpd), and both pin the SAME
   property -- "an acquire from elsewhere in the repo contends on the same
   file" -- from the two directions that can break it:
   `test_lock_path_is_identical_from_a_linked_worktree` (a real `git worktree
   add`; red if `--git-common-dir` reverts to `--git-dir`) and
   `test_lock_path_is_identical_from_a_subdirectory_of_the_main_checkout` (a
   cwd-relative path that stops resolving). Note that neither pins
   `--path-format=absolute` itself on a current git -- see that second test's
   docstring, which is explicit about the limit.

2. A concurrency stress test (lode-ao95, updated for lode-y3dw) reproducing
   the actual defect: many rounds of N-way concurrent `acquire` calls against
   the SAME manually crafted stale lock, asserting exactly one winner per
   round. Run against the pre-fix script (`rm` then create, two steps) this
   reliably shows multiple winners in some rounds; against the mkdir-gate
   design it still showed multiple winners on a starting arrangement this
   test deliberately did not cover (see its own docstring); against the
   flock'd script it must never show more than one, in any round, from ANY
   starting arrangement -- the whole point of a real mutex over a
   hand-rolled gate object. The CONTENTION LEVEL is part of the gate, not a
   free parameter. See that test's own docstring for the measurements.

3. Call-site pins against the SHIPPED `SKILL.md`. The defect lived in a
   markdown fence, where no gate reaches it, so the behavioural tests above
   would all stay green while SKILL.md quietly went back to an inline trap
   and stopped calling this script at all. Same reasoning and same shape as
   `tests/test_isolation_guard.py`'s `test_every_agent_definition_invokes_
   the_guard`.

   These pins are only as good as the parser under them, which is why one of
   them checks the parser rather than the skill:
   `test_fenced_bash_sees_every_bash_marker_including_indented_ones` asserts
   the shared `tests/conftest.py::bash_fence_blocks` helper sees every bash
   fence in SKILL.md, against an independently-derived count. Without it these
   pins silently covered 20 of 24 blocks (lode-ovgs).

4. The flock portability fallback (lode-y3dw): `acquire` refuses to proceed,
   reporting a MACHINE FAULT and skipping the tick, when `flock(1)` is not on
   PATH, rather than silently reverting to unsafe behaviour on a platform
   (macOS, stock git-bash) that lacks util-linux.

Retired by lode-y3dw, not restated here: the mkdir-gate-specific tests this
file used to carry (a reclaim gate's self-heal, its owner-token re-check, and
the `LAND_LOCK_TEST_STALL_SECONDS` test-only stall hook that staged the
alive-but-stalled-holder displacement). `flock(1)` closes the whole class of
races those tests existed to pin -- there is no gate object left for them to
exercise. See scripts/land-lock.sh's header (CAVEAT 2) for the full history.

    test above passes for any default over 120s -- so before this pin, the one
    number carrying the whole safety margin could be lowered with nothing going
    red. It is not an arbitrary constant: lode-m87j's `heartbeat` bounds the
    *dangerous* direction (a live pass reclaimed mid-merge), but the window
    must still outlast the longest unheartbeated stretch, and the binding one
    -- a single `land-review` Opus dispatch -- has never been measured. Agent
    dispatches in this repo run to double-digit minutes, so a 600s window is
    the same order as the gap rather than clear of it; the reduction lode-m87j
    proposed was reverted for exactly that reason (see scripts/land-lock.sh,
    CAVEAT 1). Lowering it is lode-cp4o's job, and requires the measurement.

    Asserted behaviourally, from the outside: a lock 1700s old is still held,
    a lock 1900s old is stale. Deliberately not a grep for the literal -- this
    fails if the semantics change, not merely if the digits move.

    The 100s margins are deliberate, and were 1s until lode-44cq: the age is
    stamped from ONE clock read here, in Python, then measured against a
    SECOND, later read inside `land-lock.sh`'s own subprocess, so under load
    (`-n 8`, interpreter/bash startup, git work) that gap could exceed a
    second and age a 1799s lock past 1800s -- a false, one-sided red. This is
    the same hazard `test_fresh_lock_is_not_reclaimed_under_a_large_threshold`
    calls out for its own boundary; the margin is how this file has always
    handled it (every other threshold test here uses a 2x-or-wider ratio).

    The trade is real: the pin now catches only a default outside
    (1700s, 1900s), so a lowering to e.g. 1750s would slip through. Measured
    on this branch -- defaults of 900s and 3600s each turn it red, 1750s does
    not.

    Rejected as worse: injecting a pinned "now" into the script. That would
    put a test-only env var directly into the *decision* input of a
    production lock's staleness path -- unlike `LAND_LOCK_FLOCK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`
    (used elsewhere in this file), which only bounds how long an `acquire`
    waits and cannot change which decision it reaches.

        8-way,  200 rounds -> 0 multi-winner   (the bug is INVISIBLE here)

    lode-y3dw's whole thesis is that BOTH acquire paths (fresh attempt and
    reclaim) execute inside ONE mutex. The measured route 2 it closed was
    precisely the fresh path executing OUTSIDE the reclaim's serialization:
    a top-of-script `write_lock` landing between a reclaimer's staleness
    decision and its `rm -f "$LOCK"` wins, and then the reclaimer's `rm`
    destroys that record and its own `write_lock` succeeds into the hole --
    two winners.

    This is pinned STRUCTURALLY rather than behaviourally, and that is a
    deliberate choice rather than a shortcut. MEASURED during lode-y3dw's
    technical review: with the fresh `write_lock` moved back above the
    `flock` acquisition (route 2 reintroduced verbatim, portability check
    left in place), the ENTIRE module -- including the 32-way x 40-round

    extra stress arrangement does NOT help either -- starting a round with
    NO lock present still yields exactly one winner even with route 2
    reintroduced, because `write_lock`'s `noclobber` is itself atomic. What
    actually distinguishes the two designs is WHERE the call sits, so that

    `bash_fence_blocks` itself: derive the EXPECTED fence count a second,
    unrelated way (a plain stripped-line ```bash/```sh marker count) and
    assert the parser's own block count matches it.

    This is the shape the ticket asked for explicitly: a startswith-anchored
    parser undercounts (it saw 20 of 24 blocks against the shipped file when
    this test was written -- 4 indented fences invisible to it), so this
    test would have failed against the pre-fix parser without needing to
    know in advance which blocks are indented or where.

    Sabotage recipe (recorded per this repo's non-vacuous-test standard):
    in tests/conftest.py's `bash_fence_blocks`, replace `stripped = line.strip()`
    with `stripped = line` (i.e. stop stripping before the fence-marker check,
    reintroducing the exact column-0-anchored bug this ticket fixes). Every
    caller of `bash_fence_blocks` -- this test included -- then parses only 20
    blocks against this file instead of 24, and this test goes red reporting
    exactly that mismatch. Restoring `stripped = line.strip()` turns it green
    again. Verified by hand against this exact file while writing this ticket.

    The independent count must recognize the same FENCE SHAPES the parser
    does, or it stops being an independent second derivation and becomes a
    stale narrower one: lode-p4qb widened `bash_fence_blocks` to open on
    four-or-more backticks and on `~~~`, and against an exactly-three-backtick
    marker count the first author to write the four-backtick form -- the one
    the parser's own docstring says an author MUST use for a block containing
    a ```-prefixed line -- would fail this test on a CORRECT parse, with a
    message blaming the parser for missing a fence it actually found.
    Measured while widening it: one added four-backtick (or tilde) bash fence
    took land/SKILL.md to 25 parsed against 24 markers. What stays independent
    is the METHOD -- a flat per-line marker count, no state machine, no call
    into the parser -- not the grammar.

    KNOWN GAP on one axis, opened by lode-kjei and left deliberately unfixed:
    the parser now refuses to open a bash fence NESTED inside an enclosing
    non-bash fence (CommonMark -- a fence cannot open inside an open fence), but
    a flat per-line count cannot see nesting and still counts the inner marker.
    Measured on this exact file while reviewing lode-kjei: as shipped, 24
    markers / 24 parsed, green; append one illustrative ````text block
    containing a ```bash example and it becomes 25 markers / 24 parsed, so this
    test goes RED blaming the parser for missing a fence it correctly declined.
    Latent -- zero nested fence openers exist across the repo's 58 tracked .md
    files. Not fixed here because the only fix is to make the count
    nesting-aware, i.e. give it a state machine, which is precisely the
    independence this test trades on. If someone ever adds such a block to
    land/SKILL.md, the answer is to re-derive the expected count some third way,
    NOT to relax the parser.

    lode-wroz widened the parser again -- one leading blockquote marker is
    stripped from every line -- so the count strips it too, through the SAME
    `_BLOCKQUOTE_MARKER` the parser normalizes with. Sharing the marker shape
    is not sharing the method: still a flat per-line count, no scan loop.
    Verified against a scratch copy with one illustrative `> ```bash` /
    `> echo hi` / `> ``` ` block appended: without the strip, one fewer
    marker than parsed blocks, and this test goes red blaming the parser for
    finding a fence the counter simply could not see under its blockquote;
    with it, the two agree. No blockquoted fence exists in land/SKILL.md
    today, so the strip is a measured no-op as shipped.
