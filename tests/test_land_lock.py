"""Tests for scripts/land-lock.sh (lode-aps3).

WHY the trap-and-PID design this replaces could not work -- an agent runs
each fenced `bash` block of `.claude/skills/land/SKILL.md` as its own Bash
invocation, so a `trap ... EXIT` fires before the next section runs and a
recorded PID is *always* already dead -- and why the replacement is a
wall-clock staleness token: see the header comment of scripts/land-lock.sh.
That rationale is deliberately NOT restated here (the
tests/test_blocks_dependents.py precedent) -- it lives next to the code it
constrains, so it cannot drift out of sync with a second copy. The header
also records the two known limits of the mechanism (the TTL measures
acquisition age, not idle time; the reclaim path is not atomic).

What this file adds on top of that is the regression gate, in two halves:

1. Behavioural tests that run the ACTUAL script against a real, throwaway
   git repository in `tmp_path` (its only external dependency is
   `git rev-parse --git-dir`, to place the lock under `.git/`) -- no fake
   git, no mocked subprocess. Reintroducing either half of the old design
   turns these red: a `trap` release makes
   `test_second_acquire_without_release_is_skipped_while_fresh` fail (the
   lock is gone by the next invocation), and a `kill -0` liveness check
   makes `test_fresh_lock_with_an_unreachable_pid_is_not_reclaimed` fail.
   Both mutations were run against this file and confirmed red (5 and 6
   failures of 14 respectively).

2. Call-site pins against the SHIPPED `SKILL.md`. The defect lived in a
   markdown fence, where no gate reaches it, so the behavioural tests above
   would all stay green while SKILL.md quietly went back to an inline trap
   and stopped calling this script at all. Same reasoning and same shape as
   `tests/test_isolation_guard.py`'s `test_every_agent_definition_invokes_
   the_guard`.
