"""The committed PreToolUse(Bash) guard against writing to an external tracker (lode-o29m),
now DEFAULT-DENY with a read-only ALLOWLIST (lode-9mbt) rather than a write-verb denylist.

USER RULE: an agent must never WRITE to an external tracker (GitHub, upstream repos, any
third-party) under the user's identity. The `gh` CLI is authed as the user, so `gh issue
create` / `gh pr comment` / etc. go out publicly under the user's name -- lode-s1uz's builder
did exactly this (filed https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/issues/4766) because its ticket's
own scope asked for it. The ticket's own scope is never authorisation for spending the user's
public identity. `.claude/settings.json` carries a PreToolUse hook that denies any `gh` call
that does not match a small, explicit read-only allowlist, and returns the draft-and-surface
protocol as the deny reason.

WHY DEFAULT-DENY, NOT A DENYLIST (lode-9mbt). The original guard enumerated write verbs and
denied only those -- a LIST OF VERBS, NOT A CATEGORY. lode-9l3d's technical review demonstrated
empirically that this shape rots: every `gh` release can add a write verb, and the guard
silently gets weaker with nothing in this repo changing (`gh codespace create`, `gh repo
rename`, `gh repo archive`, `gh repo deploy-key add` all fell through even after lode-9l3d
widened the alternation -- see lode-9rim, superseded by this ticket). The asymmetry settles it:
a FALSE ALLOW is a public write under the user's identity, unrecoverable in the sense that
matters (the notification already went out); a FALSE DENY blocks a read, which an agent
reports and a human unblocks in seconds. Default-deny puts the cheap failure on the common
path. The read surface is small, stable, and enumerable (view/list/status/checks/diff); the
write surface is none of those things.

These tests execute the hook *as shipped* -- extracted from the real settings.json and run
exactly as the harness runs it (payload on stdin) -- following the same rationale as
test_bd_deps_guard.py: prose alone is advisory, and a regex guard's failure mode is silent
under- or over-matching. Nothing but a test table catches that here either.

THE "api" SUBCOMMAND IS THE HARD PART. It is read-or-write depending on flags, so it cannot be
allowed merely by matching a verb -- it needs a POSITIVE read test. Allowed only when:
  - an explicit `-X GET` / `--method GET` is present (regardless of whether fields are also
    present -- fields on an explicit GET are a documented way to send a query string), OR
  - no `-f`/`-F`/`--field`/`--raw-field`/`--input` field flag is present AND no explicit method
    is present at all (the plain, bodyless form defaults to GET).
Any other shape is denied -- and note the second arm denies on the mere PRESENCE of a method
that is not an explicit GET, so the guard contains no `POST|PUT|PATCH|DELETE` list to keep up
to date: an HTTP method nobody enumerated is denied for the same structural reason `gh
codespace create` is. `gh api` switches to POST automatically as soon as a body field is supplied ("adding
request parameters will automatically switch the request method to POST", per `gh api
--help`), so `gh api repos/o/r/issues -f title=x -f body=y` files an issue with no
`-X`/`--method` anywhere on the line. That is the *ordinary*, documented way to POST with `gh`,
not an exotic evasion, and the route a denied agent would reach for next -- the deny reason
even names `gh api`. A guard that missed it would not enforce the rule it claims to.

Deliberately NOT covered (fence, not fix -- same framing as lode-0kbq/lode-s1uz for the
`blocks:` guard). A guard that reads only the command STRING cannot see through:
  - quoted indirection -- `sh -c "gh issue create ..."`, or the command held in a shell
    variable. Closing this would mean treating a quote as a command boundary, which would
    false-deny this repo's own prose about the rule (`grep "gh issue create" docs/`, a
    commit message quoting the verb) -- a worse trade than the residual.
  - non-`gh` routes: `curl` against a tracker REST API, a non-GitHub tracker's own CLI.
Both residuals are honest, structural, and unaffected by the denylist -> allowlist inversion --
neither a wider denylist nor a narrower allowlist can see through them. They rely on the prose
rule in coding.md / code-reviewer.md, same as the `blocks:` guard relies on prose for `bd
create --graph`. What the inversion DOES close, structurally rather than by enumeration: any
`gh` write verb not on the read-only allowlist -- including ones nobody has thought to name yet.

QUOTE-AWARE SPLIT (lode-obox). The guard's own scanning logic now lives in
scripts/gh-write-guard.sh (extracted from settings.json, mirroring scripts/sha-fabrication-guard.sh
-- lode-fpmi's precedent) so its control-operator split can be QUOTE-AWARE: the old inline `tr`
split fired on control characters inside quoted string arguments too, manufacturing a fake segment
start and denying pure prose. Mechanism, the confirmed repros, and the `$(...)`/backtick carve-out
(inside DOUBLE quotes those two are live command substitution and MUST still split, unlike `;`
`|` `(` `{`) are documented once, canonically, in docs/agents-workflow.md -- see the
"False-positive class" subsection under the lode-o29m section. What lives only here: the two
tables below are the guard's entire memory of what "known safe" looks like, and every `DENIED`
case still denies against the new script, so the fix demonstrably narrowed nothing.
