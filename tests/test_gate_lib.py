"""Tests for scripts/gate-lib.sh (lode-090f).

Why the shared helpers there -- `gate_could_not_run()` and, built on it,
`escalate_unless_content()` (lode-1mea) -- were extracted, and what the
GATE_ADVISORY contract is: see that script's own header. It is the single
source for all of it -- not restated here. (docs/decisions.md carries a
dated snapshot of the lode-ysr6 decision, which is a log entry, not a
second source: the header is what gets corrected when the contract
changes.)

The tests in the first half exercise the library directly, under `bash -c
'...'` sourcing it the same way every real caller does
(`. "$(dirname "$0")/gate-lib.sh"`), rather than through any one of the
consuming scripts -- those each keep their own regression tests, which double
as this library's integration coverage.

The SWEEPS in the second half are the other half of the division of labour,
and they are deliberately not written per-consumer: they DISCOVER the consumer
set at runtime, so a script that starts sourcing the library tomorrow is
covered the day it lands rather than the day someone remembers to write a
sixth near-identical test. That distinction is not academic here:
land-merge-one.sh spent its entire life as a stranded inline copy precisely
because nothing enumerated the set, and it took a manual audit (lode-bss5) to
notice. A test that hard-codes the list IS that list.

What "discover" MEANS is itself load-bearing, and a whole-file
`grep -l gate-lib.sh scripts/*.sh` is not it (lode-pcee). That matches any
MENTION of the library -- including a comment explaining why a script
deliberately does not use it. scripts/assert-main-checkout.sh is exactly that
case: a precondition guard whose header documents the decision not to route
through gate-lib.sh. It was swept in as a phantom consumer and failed all
three parametrized sweeps over a library it never sources, and the only way to
stay green would have been to stop naming the library it was explaining it did
not use. `_consumers()` therefore anchors on a real, non-comment SOURCE line,
so what it computes matches the docstring it has always carried.

Three invariants are swept, all of which were previously unenforceable
mechanically and left to per-consumer convention:

* every consumer GUARDS its source, so a missing/unreadable gate-lib.sh
  exits 2 rather than falling through to 0/1/127 (lode-bss5, Finding B);
* every consumer's source line supplies either its advisory lines or the
  literal `--no-advisory` sentinel -- never a bare source with zero trailing
  tokens (lode-ysr6, see below);
* every consumer SOURCES the library above its first call site, so no
  `gate_could_not_run`/`escalate_unless_content` call can hit an unbound
  function (lode-b4md, see below).

NON-VACUITY (acceptance criterion): sabotaging any of the three -- reverting
a consumer's guard to the bare source it had before lode-bss5, stripping a
no-advisory consumer's `--no-advisory` sentinel, or splicing a call site above
the source -- must make the sweep fail, and for the two RUNTIME invariants must
reproduce the actual consequence on the real script. All three are proven below
rather than asserted; a gate that cannot fail is not a gate. The third is
positional rather than behavioural, so its proof is textual -- see its own
docstring for why a subprocess would add nothing there.

WHY THE OLD "GATE_ADVISORY ORDERING" SWEEP IS GONE (lode-ysr6): it compared
the line number of a consumer's separate `GATE_ADVISORY=(...)` statement
against its `gate_could_not_run` call sites. No consumer has such a statement
any more -- gate-lib.sh binds GATE_ADVISORY itself, at source time -- so the
sweep has nothing left to compare and was deleted rather than rewritten. The
hazard it swept for, and why it is now unrepresentable, is owned by
gate-lib.sh's own header. The narrower discipline that replaces it is the
advisory-or-sentinel sweep. Note this is NOT the same thing as the
source-before-call-site sweep (lode-b4md), which is also an ordering check but
over a different pair: the SOURCE line versus the call sites, not a separate
`GATE_ADVISORY=` statement versus them.

    `escalate_unless_content`, which is NOT the helper any consumer's first
