"""Tests for scripts/stacked-graph.sh -- stacked land-branch detection, on
real git repos. (lode-s9xe.2)

This logic used to live as bash inside .claude/skills/land/SKILL.md, where it
did not parse (its outer loop was a comment) and could not be tested at all.
Every case below is a repo built by `_repo()` and measured, not a string
match against markdown. Wiring `SKILL.md` to call this script, and deleting
the old non-parsing fenced block, is the `.6` family's job, not this
ticket's -- see lode-s9xe.2's own scope-narrowing note.

The cases that matter are the ones the skill's prose warns about and that a
plausible reimplementation gets wrong:

  * a base whose tip MOVED after the dependent merged it (tip-ancestry fails here)
  * a pair with TWO merge-bases, one of which is on trunk
    (single-result `git merge-base` picks arbitrarily and misses the stack)
  * SIBLINGS on a common base (related, but no edge is the correct answer)
  * transitive stacks, where "nearest base" is what /land must diff against
