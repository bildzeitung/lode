"""Regression pin for lode-42fh: `.claude/skills/sweep/SKILL.md` Section 2b's
`started_at` 24h age discriminator (added by lode-3k6x) had no test executing
the real fenced block. This pins that arithmetic mechanically.

What it pins: a ticket claimed just under 24h ago is NOT listed; one claimed
just over 24h ago IS listed; a `null` `started_at` and an ABSENT `started_at`
key are both listed (no age evidence to exclude them on); and a healthy query
exits 0 writing real content, not the `SWEEP-QUERY-ERROR` sentinel.

NON-VACUITY, verified by execution against a mutated `.claude/skills/sweep/SKILL.md`
(re-run either mutation by hand if this test's coverage is ever doubted):
- flip `<` to `>` in the `select()` clause -> the under-24h row is listed and
  the over-24h row is not, reddening both boundary assertions;
- drop the `.started_at == null or` branch -> jq's `fromdateiso8601` raises on
  the null row, `pipefail` trips, and the block writes `SWEEP-QUERY-ERROR`,
  reddening the sentinel assertion.
Deliberately NOT shipped as mutation tests of their own: they would assert only
that a mutant behaves differently (which the assertions below already imply),
while coupling permanently to the exact jq source text.

Same fake-`bd`-on-PATH-plus-real-fenced-block pattern as
tests/test_sweep_source_query_failure.py and tests/test_sweep_new_ids_ordering.py;
block extraction is tests/conftest.py::bash_fence_blocks (lode-kjei), execution
is tests/conftest.py::run_block (lode-n6q0).
