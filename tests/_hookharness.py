"""Shared harness for driving the committed `PreToolUse(Bash)` guards in `.claude/settings.json`
*as actually shipped* -- never a reimplementation (lode-zlg8).

`test_bd_deps_guard.py` (lode-ij24), `test_gh_write_guard.py` (lode-o29m), and
`test_sha_fabrication_guard.py` (lode-fpmi) each independently defined a near-identical pair of
helpers -- one to pull a hook's shell one-liner out of the committed settings.json by matching a
substring, one to run it as a subprocess against a synthetic PreToolUse payload and unwrap the
`hookSpecificOutput`. Three copies of the harness contract (payload shape, exit-0 assertion,
`hookSpecificOutput` unwrap) meant every future change to it was an N-file edit, and let one copy
(`test_gh_write_guard.py`) silently drift onto `bash` instead of `/bin/sh` unnoticed -- see below.

CRITICAL (lode-9gm2): the Claude Code harness runs every PreToolUse hook under its `/bin/sh`,
which on Linux is **dash**, not bash -- and dash rejects bash-only constructs (`${var//pat/repl}`
pattern substitution, `$'...'` ANSI-C quoting) with a hard "Bad substitution" error that bricks
the Bash tool for the rest of the session (lode-m6px's first attempt at one of these guards
shipped exactly that, verified green by a test suite that drove the hook through `bash -c` and so
could not see the defect). `run_hook` below therefore always drives the hook through `/bin/sh -c`,
never `bash -c` -- that is the whole point: a test using bash cannot catch this class of bug,
which is exactly how it shipped once already, and exactly how `test_gh_write_guard.py`'s own
`shutil.which("bash")` call went unnoticed until this file existed to make the choice explicit and
shared (lode-zlg8).

    tests (lode-p8zl), whose guard reads no `tool_input` at all and only needs a plausible
    Edit/Write payload shape to drive.

    `path`, when given, overrides `PATH` for the subprocess only -- used to simulate a jq-less
    machine (lode-oii9) without touching the real `PATH` of the process running the test. `sh`
    itself is invoked by its resolved path so a stripped `PATH` cannot make it unresolvable.

    `cwd`, when given, overrides the subprocess's working directory -- used by guards (like
    lode-fpmi's and lode-p8zl's) whose logic depends on `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` resolving
    a real repo.

    `project_dir`, when given, sets `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` -- used by the guards that resolve a
    helper script under it (lode-obox), to point them at a directory where that script is
