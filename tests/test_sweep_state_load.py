"""Pins lode-3oik: `.claude/skills/sweep/SKILL.md`'s `$SWEEP_TMP` load cluster
adopts `scripts/land-state-load.sh` (lode-dc4n) for its "default" policy sites
(missing fatal, empty OK), and the two `2>/dev/null` sites (deferred/stranded
in the report/publish section) are deliberately left alone -- their
missing-file behaviour is a non-fatal third state, which neither of
`land-state-load.sh`'s two policies expresses.

Same discipline as `tests/test_land_conflicts_state.py`'s exact call-site
pins: this asserts the literal call each retrofitted site makes, never a
character-proximity/distance check, so a future edit that quietly reverts a
site to a bare `cat` (silently flipping its policy back to a hand-rolled
spelling -- the exact hazard lode-dc4n's own rationale names) turns this file
red.

Pinned against the SHIPPED SKILL.md, not a reimplementation -- the bug class
this guards against lives in a markdown fence no other gate parses.
