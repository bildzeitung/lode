"""Pins lode-rfon's fix: $CONFLICTS must survive from its producer to the
"Needs rebase -- kick back" consumer in `.claude/skills/land/SKILL.md`.

An agent executing this skill runs each fenced ```bash block as its own,
separate Bash tool invocation -- shell variables do not survive between them
(the same defect class lode-sfnb closed for $MSG/$ACCEPTED/$LANDED). Before
this fix, $CONFLICTS was captured in Section 2b's `merge-precheck.sh` call and
in each of Section 3's two `land-merge-one.sh` merge loops, but the "Needs
rebase -- kick back" block that interpolates it into a `bd --append-notes` is
a later, separate block -- so $CONFLICTS read there was always empty, and the
kick-back note silently got a blank line where the conflicting paths belong.

The fix persists $CONFLICTS to a file under `$STATE_DIR/conflicts/<id>`
(`.git/land-state/conflicts/<id>`) at each producer site, reusing the
$STATE_DIR mechanism lode-sfnb already established for the accepted/landed/msg
files, and has the kick-back block read it back from disk -- refusing loudly
(never with a blank paths section) if that file is missing or empty.

Pinned against the SHIPPED SKILL.md, not a reimplementation (the
tests/test_land_lock.py precedent) -- the bug lived in a markdown fence no
gate parses, so only reading the actual file catches a regression.

lode-wjw4 extended this file to the OTHER half of the same mechanism: WHERE
the per-pass `rm -rf "$STATE_DIR"` sits. It used to run in Section 3a, three
sections after the pass began and after 2b had already written its conflicts
record, so 2b was ordered IN PROSE to kick back before 3a ran or lose the
file. The wipe is hoisted to Section 1, ahead of every writer, which makes
that ordering structural instead of remembered -- and the pins below are what
keep it that way, since nothing else in this repo parses this markdown.

lode-youi generalized this file's charter accordingly: it now owns DOCUMENT-ORDER
invariants of `.claude/skills/land/SKILL.md` that no other gate parses, not only
the $CONFLICTS/$STATE_DIR ones the paragraphs above describe. The pin added there
(Section 3's re-gate precedes Section 4's `origin/trunk` push) is about neither
$CONFLICTS nor $STATE_DIR; it lives here because this is where the block-boundary
scaffolding and the cross-block-ordering precedent already are.
