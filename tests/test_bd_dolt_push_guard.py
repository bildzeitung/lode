"""Tests for scripts/bd-dolt-push-guard.sh and its integration into
scripts/bd-dolt-push.sh (lode-fzau).

Background: a code-reviewer/coding launch worktree was observed with a STRAY,
worktree-local bd DB -- bootstrap-hydrated from that branch's committed,
passively-lagging `.beads/issues.jsonl` -- instead of resolving to the ONE
shared main-checkout DB. A bd write against a ticket that happened to exist in
that stale snapshot would have succeeded SILENTLY against the stray DB, and
`bd-dolt-push.sh` would then have published that stale DB over
`refs/dolt/data`, reverting real cross-machine state.

A dispatched diagnostic could NOT reproduce the underlying stray-DB mechanism
(10 separate probes, including a live re-run of the ticket's own repro steps,
all resolved to the ONE shared, authoritative DB) -- so this is a BACKSTOP
against a mechanism that is real (it happened once) but not understood, not a
fix for a reproduced defect (human decision, recorded in lode-fzau's notes and
`--design`). It refuses a push when EITHER: (1) the resolved `.beads`
directory carries bd's own `.auto-import-issues.jsonl` marker (evidence the
local DB was hydrated from a passive jsonl snapshot), or (2) the current issue
count is wildly (default: >10%) below a local, per-DB-path high-water-mark
cache file that `bd-dolt-push.sh` itself writes after every successful push --
a network-free proxy for "wildly below the remote's count", since our own
last confirmed-pushed count can only be a floor on what the remote actually
has.

Both checks are designed to fail OPEN rather than block a legitimate push:
a fresh clone / `bd init` never touches this guard at all (`bd init` uses
`bd dolt pull`, not a jsonl import, and never calls `bd-dolt-push.sh`), and a
DB with no cache file yet (the common first-push case) has no baseline for
check 2, so it does not fire. `bd where`/`bd count` failing is itself treated
as "cannot assess, don't block" -- the real `bd dolt push` will surface any
genuine bd-level failure on its own.

The fake `bd` shim below drives `bd where --json` / `bd count --json` /
`bd dolt push` / `bd dolt pull` purely from environment variables (no fixture
files needed -- this guard's interface is much narrower than the epic-
completion scripts' `bd show`/`bd list` payloads).
