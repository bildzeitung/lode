"""ONE importable CommonMark fence-parsing primitive (``lode-ee7b``).

Hosts the three CommonMark rules every fence-aware scanner in this repo needs
to agree on: a fence may be indented, is opened by a run of three-or-more
backticks or tildes, and is closed only by a run of the SAME marker character
that is AT LEAST AS LONG as the opener (so a ```` ``` ```` line inside a
four-backtick block, or a ``~~~`` line inside a ```` ``` ````-opened block, is
content, not a close).

Importable from **both** ``src/`` and ``tests/`` -- this module is under
``src/lode/`` specifically so production code (``docs_index_chunker.py``) can
use it without tests/ needing to import from src/ or vice versa creating a
one-way dependency tests/ already has on src/ anyway (pytest's own
``sys.path`` setup makes ``src/`` importable from ``tests/``).

Before this module, the same three rules were independently hand-rolled
TWICE: in ``tests/conftest.py``'s ``fence_scan`` (test-side gates) and in
``src/lode/docs_index_chunker.py``'s former ``_fence_flags`` (the docs-index
chunker). ``scripts/check_links.py`` is a third fence scanner but not a third
copy: its ``_content_lines`` deliberately implements a DIFFERENT, simpler rule (toggles
on ANY fence-looking line, regardless of marker character or length) and is
NOT a consumer of this module; see its own docstring for why.

``tests/conftest.py``'s ``fence_scan`` is a consumer of the two primitives
below (:func:`match_fence_marker`, :func:`closes_fence`) rather than a
re-implementation, though it stays the sole home of everything ELSE it adds on
top: blockquote-marker stripping, info-string capture, block-ordinal
numbering, and unterminated-fence flushing. Those are consumer-side features,
not part of the shared CommonMark rule set itself.

    blockquote-marker stripping first (``tests/conftest.py``'s ``fence_scan``)
    does that itself before consulting :func:`match_fence_marker` /
    :func:`closes_fence` directly, since the strip changes what "stripped"
    means per line.

    Built on the two primitives above rather than on a private regex of its
    own: a second copy of the marker alternation *inside* the one sanctioned
    home is exactly the drift this module exists to end, and the AST gate
    cannot see it here (regex-shaped machines are a documented detector blind
    spot). One consequence, deliberate: a would-be closer carrying trailing
    content (```` ```python ````) is content, not a close -- CommonMark's rule,
    and the rule ``fence_scan`` has always applied. Measured against the real
    ``docs/`` corpus: unit count unchanged.
